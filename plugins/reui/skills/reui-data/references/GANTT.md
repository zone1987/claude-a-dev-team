Free component — no licence key required. This primitive also powers 4 ready-made ReUI Pro blocks
(complete gantt sections built on top of this component); those blocks are premium and out of scope
for this reference.

The `gantt` package ships a subscribable headless engine (`useGanttState`) and a composable view
layer on top of it: a resizable tree pane for the resource hierarchy, a horizontal timeline with day,
week, month, quarter, and year scales, zoom, infinite scrolling, drag and resize scheduling with live
validation, per-bar progress fills, and duration-weighted summary rollups on parent rows. The engine
never mutates your data on its own; every timing change flows through one proposal funnel
(`onEventUpdate`, `canDropEvent`) so external CRUD stays in your hands.

The composition contract is `<Gantt><GanttNav /><GanttView /></Gantt>`. The root provides the
calendar instance and the view configuration through context; the nav family, the view, and
`GanttBar` all read from it, so any piece can be replaced with your own markup driven by the same
hooks.

## Installation

```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @reui/gantt
```

(npm/yarn/bun equivalents: `npx shadcn@latest add @reui/gantt`, `yarn dlx shadcn@latest add
@reui/gantt`, `bunx shadcn@latest add @reui/gantt`.)

## Usage

```tsx
import { Gantt } from "@/components/reui/gantt/gantt"
import { GanttNav, GanttToolbar } from "@/components/reui/gantt/gantt-nav"
import type {
  GanttEvent,
  GanttResource,
} from "@/components/reui/gantt/gantt-types"
import { GanttView } from "@/components/reui/gantt/gantt-view"
```

```tsx
const resources: GanttResource[] = [
  {
    id: "design",
    title: "Design",
    children: [
      { id: "wireframes", title: "Wireframes" },
      { id: "visual-design", title: "Visual design" },
    ],
  },
]

const events: GanttEvent[] = [
  {
    id: "1",
    title: "Wireframes",
    start: new Date("2026-07-06"),
    end: new Date("2026-07-10"),
    allDay: true,
    resourceId: "wireframes",
    progress: 60,
  },
]

return (
  <Gantt
    defaultEvents={events}
    resources={resources}
    defaultScale="month"
    className="h-[480px]"
  >
    <GanttNav />
    <GanttView />
  </Gantt>
)
```

Give the root an explicit height (`className="h-[480px]"` or a flex parent): the root is a
min-height-zero flex column and the view fills whatever it gets. The root also owns the type scale:
every gantt label inherits its text size (`text-xs` by default), so `className="text-sm"` scales the
whole component up in one place. Events work controlled (`events` + `onEventsChange`) or
uncontrolled (`defaultEvents`); the same pairs exist for `scale`, `date`, `selection`, and
`interactions`. Every drag, resize, and API timing change is proposed through `onEventUpdate` before
it commits, `canDropEvent` validates live during the gesture, and a `false` return reverts the bar
with no cleanup on your side, which makes persisting to a backend a matter of handling one callback.

The demo at the top of the docs page is the full composition: its settings menu drives every view
configuration and interaction flag as controlled props from consumer state, and the unscheduled
Launch tasks show the slot-selection contract — hover an empty row and click the hint tile (or drag
a range) to schedule it through `onSelectSlot`. For the full set of variations, browse the Gantt
components. Full example code (the flagship demo plus the 5 named examples below) is in
[GANTT-EXAMPLES.md](./GANTT-EXAMPLES.md).

## Examples (named, on the docs page)

Full source for each is in [GANTT-EXAMPLES.md](./GANTT-EXAMPLES.md).

### Annual Product Roadmap

A long-horizon plan on the quarter scale. Workstreams are swimlane groups whose multi-month
initiatives roll up into automatic summary bars, so leadership reads the whole year at a glance and
navigates a quarter at a time. The toolbar button schedules the next backlog initiative onto its
empty row through the `addEvent` API.

### Team Capacity Schedule

A people-centric weekly view. Each row is a teammate rendered with an avatar label via
`renderResourceLabel`, their bars are the week's assignments, and weekends are shaded with `offDays`
so real working-day capacity is obvious. The toolbar drops a fresh assignment onto the next teammate,
so one person can hold several bars at once.

### Project Status Report

A report on the month scale. Owner and Status columns sit beside each phase in the tree panel via
the `columns` prop and every bar carries a progress fill. Drag, resize, and slot-select are disabled
so the plan can't be shifted by dragging, while the toolbar appends new tasks as their own rows with
controlled `resources`.

### As-Built Baseline Tracking

Planned versus actual. Every bar carries `baselineStart` and `baselineEnd`, so the frozen plan
ghosts behind the actual dates on the same lane, and equal baseline instants render a planned
milestone diamond. Dragging a bar re-times the actual dates while the ghost holds still; the tooltip
names the planned range and each bar exposes `data-baseline-variance="early|late|on-time"` for
consumer styling. The Implementation group also carries a NODE-level plan, drawn as a faint band
behind the whole row (`GanttResource.baselineStart`/`baselineEnd`). Turn the ghosts off with
`baselineBars={false}` or restyle them via `classNames.baseline`, `renderBaseline`, and
`renderRowBaseline`.

### Dependencies and Milestones

A chained rollout plan. Each event's `dependencies` array names its predecessors, and the view draws
a finish-to-start elbow arrow from every predecessor's end into the dependent's start, under the
bars. The zero-duration "Sign-off" event renders as a milestone diamond: it moves like any bar (the
move keeps it a point) but has no resize edges, its title always sits beside it, and screen readers
hear the `milestone` clause. Turn the arrows off with `dependencyLines={false}` or restyle the layer
via `classNames.dependencies`.

## API Reference

### Gantt

The root provider and container. It creates (or adopts) the calendar instance, provides it through
context, and renders a `div` shell with an `aria-live` announcer. Besides the props below, it accepts
every state option (see [State options](#state-options)), every callback (see
[Callbacks and validators](#callbacks-and-validators)), and every view configuration key (see
[View configuration](#view-configuration)) as flat props.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `calendar` | `GanttInstance` | — | Adopt a hoisted `useGanttState` instance; option props are then ignored. |
| `apiRef` | `RefObject<GanttApi \| null>` | — | Imperative escape hatch usable from outside the tree. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | — | Base UI render prop to replace the root element. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes for the root container. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | The gantt composition (`GanttNav`, `GanttToolbar`, `GanttView`). |

### GanttNav

The composed navigation bar: Today, scale switcher, prev/next, and the period title with a trailing
spacer. Pass `children` to use it as a pure layout shell instead. The title follows the viewport
center while scrolling so the header always names what you are looking at.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Custom nav content; replaces the default composition. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | — | Base UI render prop to replace the element. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

### GanttNavToday

Button that navigates to today. Renders the `today` i18n label by default and marks itself with
`data-active` while the anchor period contains now.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | i18n `today` | Custom button content. |
| `tooltip` | `ReactNode \| null` | the current date | Hover/focus-visible tooltip; `null` disables it. Never re-triggers from a pointer click. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | — | Base UI render prop to replace the button. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

### GanttNavPrev

Icon button that steps the anchor date one period back at the current scale.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | chevron icon | Custom button content. |
| `tooltip` | `ReactNode \| null` | i18n `previous` | Hover/focus-visible tooltip; `null` disables. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | — | Base UI render prop to replace the button. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

### GanttNavNext

Icon button that steps the anchor date one period forward at the current scale.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | chevron icon | Custom button content. |
| `tooltip` | `ReactNode \| null` | i18n `next` | Hover/focus-visible tooltip; `null` disables. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | — | Base UI render prop to replace the button. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

### GanttTitle

The current period title, formatted by `i18n.functions.formatTitle` and announced politely on
change.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `format` | `(ctx: { title: string }) => ReactNode` | — | Wraps or replaces the formatted title text. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | — | Base UI render prop to replace the element. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

### GanttScaleSwitcher

Dropdown that switches between the Day, Week, Month, Quarter, and Year scales. Tooltips on this
overlay-opener are hover-only so nothing flashes when focus returns after the menu closes.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scales` | `GanttScale[]` | all five | The offered scales, in menu order. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | current scale label | Custom trigger content. |
| `tooltip` | `ReactNode \| null` | i18n `selectView` | Hover-only tooltip; `null` disables. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | — | Base UI render prop to replace the trigger. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

### GanttDatePicker

Compact go-to-date picker (shadcn `Calendar` in a popover). Not part of the default `GanttNav`
composition; add it to a custom nav when needed. It has no tooltip by design because it opens an
overlay.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

### GanttToolbar

Free slot for consumer toolbar buttons; a pure layout shell that also picks up `classNames.toolbar`
from the view configuration.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Toolbar content. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | — | Base UI render prop to replace the element. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

### GanttView

The gantt body: split resizable tree and timeline panes with synced scrolling, the grouped two-row
header, lanes, bars, summary rollups, off-screen chips, the zoom control, and all pointer
interactions. Display behavior comes from the view configuration on the root.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `interval` | `number` | `interval` config | Day-scale unit interval in minutes; clamped between 15 and 240. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | — | Base UI render prop to replace the element. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

### GanttBar

The one interactive bar element, rendered by the view for every visible segment. The wrapper owns
positioning hooks, a11y, selection, drag and resize listeners, the range tooltip, the optional
right-click menu, and data attributes (`data-selected`, `data-dragging`, `data-progress`,
`data-completed`, `data-past`, `data-recurring`); content comes from `children`, the root
`renderEvent` override, or the built-in default. Exported for fully custom view compositions.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `segment` | `GanttSegment` | — | Required. The timeline segment this bar renders. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Replaces the default bar content; the interactive wrapper stays gantt-owned. |
| `labelOutside` | `boolean` | — | The title renders beside the bar (view-owned), so the default inner content is suppressed. |
| `rowTitle` | `string` | — | The owning row's title for the aria-label; omitting falls back to a memoized tree lookup. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | — | Base UI render prop to replace the button element. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

### GanttEvent

One schedulable bar. `TData` is a fully generic consumer payload.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | — | Required. Stable event id. |
| `title` | `string` | — | Required. Bar title. |
| `start` | `Date` | — | Required. Plain instant; consumers parse ISO strings themselves. |
| `end` | `Date` | — | Required. Exclusive; must be greater than or equal to `start`. Equal to `start` renders the event as a milestone diamond. |
| `allDay` | `boolean` | — | Whether the event is date-based rather than timed. |
| `recurrence` | `GanttRecurrenceRule \| string` | — | Structured rule or a raw `"RRULE:..."` line. |
| `recurringEventId` | `string` | — | This event is an edited single occurrence of that series. |
| `originalStart` | `Date` | — | Which occurrence it replaces (RECURRENCE-ID semantics). |
| `color` | `string` | — | Token or CSS color; flows to the `--gantt-event-color` CSS variable. |
| `readOnly` | `boolean` | — | Excluded from drag and resize regardless of interactions state. |
| `draggable` | `boolean` | — | Per-event override; default comes from `interactions.drag`. |
| `resizable` | `boolean` | — | Per-event override; default comes from `interactions.resize`. |
| `priority` | `number` | — | Packing prominence; feeds `getEventPriority` ordering. |
| `progress` | `number` | — | Completion 0-100; renders as a subtle fill inside the bar. |
| `baselineStart` | `Date` | — | Planned (as-built baseline) start, ghosted behind the bar. Set with `baselineEnd` or not at all. |
| `baselineEnd` | `Date` | — | Planned end, exclusive like `end`. Equal to `baselineStart` marks a planned milestone diamond. Recurring events render no baseline. |
| `zIndex` | `number` | — | Explicit stacking override; wins over the computed z. |
| `resourceId` | `string` | — | Resource row this bar belongs to. |
| `dependencies` | `GanttBarId[]` | — | Predecessor event ids (finish-to-start); each draws an elbow arrow into this bar's start. Rendering only — the gantt never reschedules dependents. |
| `data` | `TData` | — | Consumer payload, fully generic. |

### GanttResource

A row of the gantt tree (task, person, equipment). Nesting via `children` renders as collapsible
groups.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | — | Required. Stable resource id. |
| `title` | `string` | — | Required. Row title. |
| `color` | `string` | — | Token or CSS color used for subtle row accents. |
| `scheduleMode` | `"single" \| "multiple"` | — | Per-node cardinality override; falls back to the view-level `scheduleMode`. |
| `baselineStart` | `Date` | — | Planned window start for the WHOLE node, ghosted as a band behind its lanes. Set with `baselineEnd` or not at all. |
| `baselineEnd` | `Date` | — | Planned node window end, exclusive; equal to `baselineStart` marks a planned milestone. |
| `children` | `GanttResource[]` | — | Child rows; presence makes this row a group. |

### GanttOccurrence

One expanded instance of an event within the visible range (recurring events expand to many).

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | `string` | Stable per instance: `` `${event.id}::${startISO}` ``. |
| `eventId` | `string` | The source event id. |
| `event` | `GanttEvent` | The source event. |
| `start` | `Date` | Occurrence start. |
| `end` | `Date` | Occurrence end (exclusive). |
| `allDay` | `boolean` | Whether the occurrence is date-based. |
| `isRecurring` | `boolean` | Whether it came from a recurrence expansion. |
| `recurrenceIndex` | `number` | Index within the series, when recurring. |

The slice of an occurrence rendered inside one timeline range, with lane packing metadata. Passed to
`GanttBar` and every render override.

|---|---|---|
| `occurrence` | `GanttOccurrence` | The occurrence this segment slices. |
| `day` | `Date` | Range-start reference instant of the segment's slice. |
| `isStart` | `boolean` | Whether the segment contains the occurrence start. |
| `isEnd` | `boolean` | Whether the segment contains the occurrence end. |

| `startMin` | `number` | Minutes from the visible range start, clamped to the range. |
| `endMin` | `number` | Minutes from the visible range start, clamped to the range. |
| `column` | `number` | Lane assigned by overlap packing. |
| `columnCount` | `number` | Total lanes in the overlap cluster. |
| `columnSpan` | `number` | Lanes this segment may widen into. |

### GanttRecurrenceRule

Structured RFC 5545 subset. The built-in expander supports `freq` daily/weekly/monthly/yearly,
`interval`, `count`, `until`, and weekly `byWeekday` without ordinals; `byMonthDay`, `byMonth`, and
`byWeekday` outside weekly parse but throw a `GanttRecurrenceError` on expansion instead of silently
mis-expanding. Plug the `getOccurrences` option for a full engine.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `freq` | `"daily" \| "weekly" \| "monthly" \| "yearly"` | — | Required. Recurrence frequency. |
| `interval` | `number` | `1` | Period multiplier. |
| `count` | `number` | — | Total occurrence cap. |
| `until` | `Date` | — | Inclusive series end instant. |
| `byWeekday` | `Array<GanttWeekday>` | — | Weekday filter (weekly only, no ordinals). |
| `byMonthDay` | `number[]` | — | Parsed but not expanded (throws on expansion). |
| `byMonth` | `number[]` | — | Parsed but not expanded (throws on expansion). |
| `weekStart` | `GanttWeekday` | — | WKST; parses and round-trips. |
| `exDates` | `Date[]` | — | Excluded instants; matching occurrences are removed (they still consume their `count` slot). |
| `rDates` | `Date[]` | — | Extra instants added to the series, each with the event's own duration. |

`GanttWeekday` is `"MO" | "TU" | "WE" | "TH" | "FR" | "SA" | "SU"`.

### GanttProposedUpdate

The proposal handed to `onEventUpdate` and `canDropEvent` for every timing change.

| Property | Type | Description |

| `source` | `"drag" \| "resize-start" \| "resize-end" \| "keyboard" \| "api"` | What produced the proposal. |

### GanttUpdateResult

Return type of `onEventUpdate`: `false` rejects and reverts; `void` or `true` accepts;
`{ start?: Date; end?: Date; allDay?: boolean }` accepts with an adjustment.

### GanttSlotInfo

Payload of `onSlotClick`. A click is a point, not a range; `end` is reserved for future gestures.

| `start` | `Date` | Planned start. |
| `end` | `Date` | Planned end, exclusive. |
| `milestone` | `boolean` | Planned start and end coincide: a point in the plan, not a window. |
| `variance` | `GanttBaselineVariance` | Actual end against the planned end: `"early" \| "late" \| "on-time"`. |

| `variance` | `GanttBaselineVariance \| null` | Latest actual end (subtree included for groups) vs the planned end; `null` without events to compare. |

### GanttApi

The imperative surface, available as `instance.api` from `useGantt`/`useGanttState` or through the
root `apiRef`.

| Method | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `next` | `() => void` | Step one period forward (clamped to `rangeBounds`). |
| `prev` | `() => void` | Step one period back (clamped to `rangeBounds`). |

| `getEvents` | `() => GanttEvent[]` | Current events. |
| `getEvent` | `(id: string) => GanttEvent \| undefined` | Find one event by id. |
| `setEvents` | `(events: GanttEvent[]) => void` | Replace all events. |
| `addEvent` | `(event: GanttEvent) => void` | Append an event. |
| `updateEvent` | `(id: string, patch: Partial<GanttEvent>) => void` | Patch an event; timing changes route through `onEventUpdate` with source `"api"`. |

| `toZoned` | `(date: Date) => Date` | TZDate in the gantt's display time zone. |

## Hooks

Most hooks must run under a `<Gantt>` ancestor. The exceptions: `useGanttState` creates the instance
itself, `useGanttSelector` accepts an explicit instance, `useGanttSettingsVersion` takes the instance
as an argument, and `useGanttViewConfig` falls back to the default view configuration outside the
tree.

| Hook | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `useGanttState` | `(options?: UseGanttStateOptions) => GanttInstance` | Headless root hook: the full engine without any markup. Pass the instance to `<Gantt calendar={...}>` or drive fully custom UI. |
| `useGantt` | `() => GanttInstance` | The stable calendar instance; throws outside `<Gantt>`. |
| `useGanttSelector` | `(selector: (state: GanttState) => T, options?: { calendar?, isEqual? }) => T` | Fine-grained subscription with equality memoization (`Object.is` default). |
| `useGanttScale` | `() => { scale, setScale }` | Current scale and setter. |
| `useGanttNavigation` | `() => { date, title, visibleRange, activeRange, next, prev, today, goTo, isToday }` | Navigation state and actions; `title` follows the viewport center. |
| `useGanttSelection` | `() => { selection, select, selectEvent, clearSelection }` | Selection state and actions. |
| `useGanttInteractions` | `() => { interactions, setInteractions }` | Interaction switches and setter. |
| `useGanttOccurrences` | `(range?: GanttDateRange) => GanttOccurrence[]` | Expanded, sorted occurrences; defaults to the visible range. |
| `useGanttSettings` | `() => GanttSettings` | Resolved settings including merged i18n; re-renders only when settings change. |
| `useGanttSettingsVersion` | `(instance: GanttInstance) => number` | Subscribes to settings changes only (version counter, not state). |
| `useGanttViewConfig` | `() => GanttViewConfig` | Root-level display props and render overrides, for view components. |
| `useGanttBarContext` | `() => GanttBarContextValue` | The bar's subject (`occurrence`, `segment`, `isDragging`, `isSelected`); throws outside `<GanttBar>`. |
| `useGanttGestures` | `() => { beginMove, beginResize, beginCreate, canDrag, canResize }` | Per-bar and per-row pointer gesture wiring, for custom view compositions. |

## Helpers

Pure, React-free helpers exported from `gantt-lib.tsx`, the gesture utilities from `gantt-dnd.tsx`,
and `mergeGanttI18n` from `gantt-i18n.tsx`. `gantt-lib.tsx` also exports the advanced types
`GanttIndex`, `BuildIndexOptions`, `ViewRangeOptions`, `ViewDateRanges`, and `WeekStartsOn` used in
these signatures, and `gantt.tsx` exports the `GanttContext` and `GanttViewConfigContext` context
objects for advanced composition.

| Function | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `flattenResources` | `(resources: GanttResource[], depth?: number) => Array<GanttResource & { depth: number }>` | Depth-first flatten of the resource tree (parents included). |
| `reorderResources` | `(resources, resourceId, parentId, index) => GanttResource[] \| null` | Pure tree move; returns a new tree, or `null` for impossible moves. |
| `resolveOffDay` | `(day: Date, timeZone: string, config: boolean \| GanttOffDaysConfig \| undefined) => boolean` | Resolves whether a day is an off day in the display zone. |
| `getGanttDateRange` | `(scale, date, opts: { timeZone, weekStartsOn }) => { visibleRange, activeRange }` | Axis range for the anchor date at the given scale. |
| `stepGanttDate` | `(scale, date, direction: 1 \| -1, opts: { timeZone }) => Date` | The anchor date stepped one period. |
| `buildEventIndex` | `(events, visibleRange, opts: { timeZone, eventOrder?, getOccurrences? }) => { occurrences }` | Expands and sorts all occurrences for a range. |
| `defaultEventOrder` | `(a: GanttOccurrence, b: GanttOccurrence) => number` | Start ascending, longer first, then key. |
| `packTimedSegments` | `(segments: GanttSegment[]) => void` | Overlap packing for one row's timed segments; mutates `column`/`columnCount`/`columnSpan`. |
| `eventsOverlap` | `(a: { start, end }, b: { start, end }) => boolean` | Half-open range overlap test. |
| `rangesIntersect` | `(a: GanttDateRange, b: GanttDateRange) => boolean` | Half-open range intersection test. |
| `spansMultipleDays` | `(occ: { start, end }) => boolean` | True past 24h (an event ending exactly at the next midnight is single-day). |
| `resolveEventBaseline` | `(subject: { baselineStart?, baselineEnd?, recurrence? }) => GanttBaseline \| null` | The subject's validated planned window, or `null` (missing pair, inverted, or recurring). Structural: events and resources both resolve. |
| `getBaselineVariance` | `(event: GanttEvent) => GanttBaselineVariance \| null` | Actual end against the planned end; `null` when no valid baseline exists. |
| `occurrenceIntersects` | `(occ: { start, end }, range: GanttDateRange) => boolean` | Half-open visibility, except a zero-length (milestone) occurrence on the range start stays in. |
| `buildDependencyPath` | `(from: { x, y }, to: { x, y }, opts: { clearance, laneStep, arrowSize }) => GanttDependencyGeometry` | Orthogonal finish-to-start connector geometry (line + arrowhead paths), unit-agnostic. |
| `getDayKey` | `(date: Date, timeZone: string) => string` | Stable per-day key in the display time zone. |
| `getDayTotalMinutes` | `(dayStart: Date, timeZone: string) => number` | Day length in minutes; 1380/1500 on DST transition days. |
| `getRangeKey` | `(range: GanttDateRange) => string` | Cheap cache key for a range. |
| `snapMinutes` | `(minutes: number, snap: number) => number` | Rounds minutes to the snap grid. |
| `toZoned` | `(date: Date, timeZone: string) => TZDate` | The instant re-expressed in the display time zone. |
| `zonedStartOfDay` | `(date: Date, timeZone: string) => TZDate` | Zoned midnight of the day containing the instant. |
| `mergeGanttI18n` | `(overrides?: GanttI18nOverrides) => GanttI18nConfig` | Deep-partial i18n merge; replaces individual keys, never sections. |
| `wasRecentDrag` | `() => boolean` | True within 250ms of a gesture end, so click handlers can ignore the click that ends a drag. |
| `markGestureEnd` | `() => void` | Mark a non-dnd gesture (e.g. a timeline pan) so the click it ends is ignored. |

Exported constants: `GANTT_SCALES` (the five scales in menu order), `GANTT_COLORS` (ten named
Tailwind palette presets for bar colors), `GANTT_ACTIVATION` (the default activation thresholds),
`MIN_PACK_SLOT` (`30`, packing-effective minimum minutes), `MAX_OCCURRENCES` (`1000`, recurrence
expansion cap per event), `DEFAULT_GANTT_I18N` (the default i18n config), and `DEFAULT_VIEW_CONFIG`
(the default view configuration).

### Recurrence

Exported from `gantt-recurrence.tsx`. The built-in expander covers the RFC 5545 subset described
under GanttRecurrenceRule; unsupported parts throw `GanttRecurrenceError` instead of silently
mis-expanding, and expansion caps at `MAX_OCCURRENCES` (1000) per event.

| Function | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `parseRRuleString` | `(input: string, timeZone?: string) => GanttRecurrenceRule` | Parses a raw RRULE line (with or without the `RRULE:` prefix); floating `UNTIL` resolves in the display zone. |
| `formatRRuleString` | `(rule: GanttRecurrenceRule) => string` | Serializes the structured subset back to an RRULE line (without prefix). |
| `expandRecurrence` | `(event: GanttEvent, range: GanttDateRange, ctx: { timeZone: string }) => GanttOccurrence[]` | Expands one event into its occurrences intersecting the range; DST-safe wall-time iteration. |
| `GanttRecurrenceError` | `class extends Error` | Thrown for unsupported or invalid rules; catch it to fall back or surface a message. |

## Config

### State options

State and configuration options accepted by `useGanttState` and, as flat props, by `<Gantt>`. Every
controlled prop has an uncontrolled `default*` twin.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `events` | `GanttEvent[]` | — | Controlled events; pairs with `onEventsChange`. |
| `defaultEvents` | `GanttEvent[]` | `[]` | Initial events (uncontrolled). |
| `scale` | `GanttScale` | — | Controlled scale; pairs with `onScaleChange`. |
| `defaultScale` | `GanttScale` | `"day"` | Initial scale (uncontrolled). |
| `date` | `Date` | — | Controlled anchor date; pairs with `onDateChange`. |
| `defaultDate` | `Date` | `new Date()` | Initial anchor date (uncontrolled). |
| `selection` | `GanttSelection` | — | Controlled selection; pairs with `onSelectionChange`. |
| `defaultSelection` | `GanttSelection` | empty | Initial selection (uncontrolled). |
| `interactions` | `Partial<GanttInteractions>` | — | Controlled interaction switches; pairs with `onInteractionsChange`. |
| `defaultInteractions` | `Partial<GanttInteractions>` | all `true` | Initial interaction switches (uncontrolled). |
| `loading` | `boolean` | `false` | Loading flag mirrored into state. |
| `timeZone` | `string` | system zone | IANA display time zone. |
| `locale` | `Locale` | — | date-fns locale for all formatting. |
| `weekStartsOn` | `0 \| 1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5 \| 6` | locale's, else `0` | First day of the week; defaults from `locale` when one is set. |
| `slotDuration` | `number` | `30` | Minimum created-slot length in minutes for a bare create click. |
| `snapDuration` | `number` | `15` | Minute snapping on the day scale; other scales snap to whole zoned days. |
| `i18n` | `GanttI18nOverrides` | — | Deep-partial label/format/function overrides (see [Internationalization](#internationalization)). |
| `rangeBounds` | `{ min?: Date; max?: Date }` | — | Hard travel bounds for navigation and infinite scrolling; either side may be omitted. |
| `activation` | `GanttActivationConfig` | — | Pointer-activation threshold overrides for drag/resize/create. |
| `maxRangeWindow` | `number` | `12` | Infinite-scroll growth cap in whole periods per side; past it the anchor slides instead. |
| `resources` | `GanttResource[]` | `[]` | Resource rows of the gantt tree. |
| `enforceCanDrop` | `boolean` | `false` | Make `canDropEvent` binding: releasing an invalid gesture reverts it instead of committing anyway. |
| `getEventPriority` | `(event: GanttEvent) => number` | `event.priority ?? 0` | Packing prominence per event. |
| `eventOrder` | `(a: GanttOccurrence, b: GanttOccurrence) => number` | priority-aware | Occurrence sort; the default orders higher `getEventPriority` first, then start/duration/key. |
| `getOccurrences` | `(event, range, ctx: { timeZone: string }) => Array<GanttOccurrence> \| null` | — | Escape hatch for exotic recurrence: return the expanded occurrences yourself. |

### Callbacks and validators

All callbacks live beside the state options on `useGanttState` and `<Gantt>`.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `onEventClick` | `(occurrence, e: React.MouseEvent) => void` | Bar click (the click that ends a drag is ignored). |
| `onEventDoubleClick` | `(occurrence, e: React.MouseEvent) => void` | Bar double click. |
| `onEventUpdate` | `(update: GanttProposedUpdate) => GanttUpdateResult` | Commit gate for every timing change; return `false` to reject, an object to adjust. |
| `canDropEvent` | `(update: GanttProposedUpdate) => boolean` | Live validity predicate while dragging or resizing; drives the destructive indicator. Advisory unless `enforceCanDrop`. |
| `onSlotClick` | `(slot: GanttSlotInfo, e: React.MouseEvent) => void` | Click on empty schedulable track (also the schedule-hint activation). |
| `onSelectSlot` | `(slot: GanttSlotDraft) => void` | Drag-create commit. |
| `canSelectSlot` | `(slot: GanttSlotDraft) => boolean` | Live validity predicate for the drag-create rectangle. |
| `onCreateTask` | `(ctx: { parentId: string \| null; index: number }) => void` | Fires when the "add task" hint is activated; create a new tree row. |
| `canCreateTask` | `(ctx: { parentId: string \| null }) => boolean` | Gates the "add task" hint; the shipped view offers root-level creation only (`parentId = null`). |
| `onResourceClick` | `(ctx: GanttColumnContext, e: React.MouseEvent) => void` | Click on a tree row's surface (chevron/checkbox/grip clicks excluded). |
| `onResourceDoubleClick` | `(ctx: GanttColumnContext, e: React.MouseEvent) => void` | Double click on a tree row's surface. |
| `onRangeChange` | `(info: GanttRangeInfo) => void` | Rendered range changed (fires once on mount); fetch remote data here. |
| `onScaleChange` | `(scale: GanttScale) => void` | Scale changed. |
| `onDateChange` | `(date: Date) => void` | Anchor date changed (navigation or an infinite-scroll anchor slide). |
| `onSelectionChange` | `(selection: GanttSelection) => void` | Selection changed. |
| `onInteractionsChange` | `(interactions: GanttInteractions) => void` | Interaction switches changed. |
| `onEventsChange` | `(events: GanttEvent[]) => void` | Events changed (accepted updates, api mutations). |
| `onResourceReorder` | `(proposal: GanttResourceReorder) => void \| false` | Commit gate for tree-row drag reorder; adopt `proposal.resources` into your `resources` state, return `false` to reject. |
| `canReorderResource` | `(proposal: GanttResourceReorder) => boolean` | Live validity predicate while a resource row is being dragged. |
| `onResourceReorderReject` | `(proposal: GanttResourceReorder) => void` | Fires when a reorder gesture is released on a rejected position; explain the rejection (a toast). |

### View configuration

Display props and render overrides. These live on `<Gantt>` as flat props (and `GanttView` accepts
`interval` directly), never in the headless options; view components read them via
`useGanttViewConfig`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nowIndicator` | `boolean` | `true` | Red now-line on the axis. |
| `interval` | `number` | `60` | Day-scale unit interval in minutes; axis units and gridlines follow it. |
| `scrollbars` | `"custom" \| "native"` | `"custom"` | Scroll implementation for the gantt body: shadcn ScrollArea or browser scrollbars. |
| `displayScheduleHint` | `boolean` | `false` | Placement hint over empty timeline track: a validated, snapped tile that opens the schedule flow. |
| `dragCreate` | `boolean` | `false` | Empty-track presses start a drag-create gesture committing through `onSelectSlot`; off means the panel drags-to-pan. |
| `displayCreateTaskHint` | `boolean` | `false` | "Add task" affordance at the foot of the tree; shown only when `canCreateTask` allows it. |
| `zoomControl` | `boolean` | `true` | Floating zoom in/out control over the track. |
| `wheelZoom` | `boolean` | `true` | Ctrl/Cmd + wheel over the timeline zooms the range, anchored on the pointer; trackpad pinch arrives as the same event. At the zoom limits the gesture returns to the browser so page zoom still works. |
| `navButtonVariant` | `"ghost" \| "outline" \| "secondary" \| "default"` | `"ghost"` | Nav button variant; all nav buttons follow it. |
| `navButtonSize` | `"sm" \| "default"` | `"sm"` | Nav button size; icon buttons use the icon twin. |
| `offDays` | `boolean \| GanttOffDaysConfig` | `true` | Off-day marking on day/week/month scales; `true` = weekends with a muted background, an object customizes it. |
| `columns` | `GanttColumn[]` | — | Extra tree-panel columns after the built-in name column; the panel scrolls horizontally, the name column stays pinned. |
| `columnsMenu` | `ReactNode` | — | Consumer slot pinned at the end of the tree-panel header, the intended home for a columns dropdown. |
| `treePanel` | `GanttTreePanelConfig` | — | Tree-panel width, splitter bounds, and resizability. |
| `timelineLines` | `"vertical" \| "both" \| "none"` | `"vertical"` | Timeline gridlines: unit boundaries only, plus row borders, or bare. |
| `barLabel` | `"inside" \| "outside" \| "auto"` | `"inside"` | Bar title placement; `"auto"` moves it outside only when the bar is too short. |
| `offscreenIndicators` | `boolean` | `true` | Edge chips that scroll to bars outside the visible timeline. |
| `infiniteScroll` | `boolean` | `true` | Extend the timeline into the past/future while scrolling near an edge (the anchor period stays the nav title). |
| `zoomRange` | `{ min?: number; max?: number; step?: number }` | `0.5 - 3`, step `0.25` | Zoom bounds and button step for the floating control. |
| `metrics` | `GanttMetrics` | — | Layout metric overrides (row/lane/unit geometry, fades, thresholds). |
| `stickyNav` | `boolean` | `false` | Sticky nav bar. |
| `rowCheckboxes` | `boolean` | `true` | Leaf-row selection checkboxes in the tree panel; uncontrolled unless `selectedRows` is passed. |
| `selectedRows` | `string[]` | — | Controlled selected row ids; pairs with `onSelectedRowsChange`. |
| `onSelectedRowsChange` | `(ids: string[]) => void` | — | Selected rows changed. |
| `collapsedGroups` | `string[]` | — | Controlled collapsed group ids; pairs with `onCollapsedGroupsChange`. |
| `defaultCollapsedGroups` | `string[]` | — | Initial collapsed group ids (uncontrolled). |
| `onCollapsedGroupsChange` | `(ids: string[]) => void` | — | Collapsed groups changed. |
| `zoom` | `number` | — | Controlled zoom multiplier; pairs with `onZoomChange`. |
| `defaultZoom` | `number` | `1` | Initial zoom multiplier (uncontrolled). |
| `onZoomChange` | `(zoom: number) => void` | — | Zoom changed. |
| `parentScheduling` | `boolean` | `false` | Allow drag-create and slot clicks on rows that have children; off means parents aggregate their subtree. |
| `summaryBars` | `boolean` | `true` | Rollup strips on parent rows without bars of their own: descendant envelope with duration-weighted progress. |
| `baselineBars` | `boolean` | `true` | Planned-window ghosts behind bars (and row bands behind nodes) carrying `baselineStart`/`baselineEnd`; display only. |
| `dependencyLines` | `boolean` | `true` | Finish-to-start arrows between bars whose events name `dependencies`, drawn under the bars. |
| `classNames` | `GanttClassNames` | — | Class overrides for nav, toolbar, view, event, baseline, and dependencies. |
| `renderEvent` | `(props: GanttRenderEventProps) => ReactNode` | — | Replaces the default bar content; the interactive wrapper stays gantt-owned. |
| `renderEventMenu` | `(props: GanttRenderEventProps) => ReactNode` | — | Right-click menu for a bar: return shadcn ContextMenu items; omit for no menu. |
| `renderResourceLabel` | `(props: GanttColumnContext) => ReactNode` | — | Tree-node label; return any rich content (icons, badges). Default is the plain title. |
| `renderResourceMenu` | `(ctx: GanttColumnContext) => ReactNode` | — | Right-click menu for a tree row (same contract as `renderEventMenu`). |
| `renderNoResources` | `() => ReactNode` | — | Rendered in the timeline body when there are no resources. |
| `renderDragPreview` | `(props: GanttDragIndicatorProps) => ReactNode` | — | Replaces the smooth cursor-following move clone; the gantt owns the wrapper and positions it per pointermove. |
| `renderResizeIndicator` | `(props: GanttDragIndicatorProps) => ReactNode` | — | Replaces the resize edge line and status chip; same positioning contract as `renderDragPreview`. |
| `renderScheduleHint` | `(props: GanttScheduleHintProps) => ReactNode` | — | Replaces the schedule-hint tile and bubble inside the snapped, validated, pointer-transparent wrapper. |
| `renderSummary` | `(props: GanttSummaryProps) => ReactNode` | — | Replaces the parent rollup strip (the positioned wrapper stays gantt-owned). |
| `renderBaseline` | `(props: GanttBaselineProps) => ReactNode` | — | Replaces the baseline ghost's content, the milestone diamond included (the positioned wrapper stays gantt-owned). |
| `renderRowBaseline` | `(props: GanttRowBaselineProps) => ReactNode` | — | Replaces the ROW baseline band's content (same wrapper contract as `renderBaseline`). |
| `getSummaryProgress` | `(ctx: { resource: GanttResource; events: GanttEvent[] }) => number \| null` | — | Replaces the rollup math: return 0-100 (or `null` to hide). Default: duration-weighted mean progress. |

### GanttInteractions

Global interaction switches; per-event `readOnly`, `draggable`, and `resizable` override them.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `drag` | `boolean` | `true` | Horizontal move within the bar's own row; never across rows. |
| `resize` | `boolean` | `true` | Edge resize on bar segments. |
| `selectSlot` | `boolean` | `true` | Slot selection (drag-create and slot clicks). |

### GanttOffDaysConfig

Off-day (non-working day) marking. `true` uses the defaults: weekends with a muted background.
Marked cells carry `data-off` for CSS-selector customization.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

### GanttColumn

One extra tree-panel column after the built-in name column.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | — | Required. Stable id; doubles as the default header label. |

### Internationalization

The `i18n` option takes a `GanttI18nOverrides` object: a deep-partial of `GanttI18nConfig` where a
partial override replaces individual keys, never whole sections (merged by `mergeGanttI18n`,
defaults in `DEFAULT_GANTT_I18N`).

| `selectView` | `string` | `"Select view"` |
| `zoomIn` | `string` | `"Zoom in"` |
| `zoomOut` | `string` | `"Zoom out"` |
| `resizePanel` | `string` | `"Resize panel"` |
| `jumpToBar` | `(title: string) => string` | `` `Scroll to "${title}"` `` |
| `progress` | `(percent: number) => string` | `` `${percent}% complete` `` |
| `durationDays` | `(days: number) => string` | `"1 day"` / `` `${days} days` `` |
| `continues` | `string` | `"continues"` |
| `planned` | `(rangeLabel: string) => string` | `` `Planned ${rangeLabel}` `` |
| `milestone` | `string` | `"milestone"` |
| `scales` | `Record<GanttScale, string>` | `Day`, `Week`, `Month`, `Quarter`, `Year` |

`formats` are date-fns format strings, applied with the gantt `locale`:

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `monthTitle` | `"MMMM yyyy"` | Month-scale title. |
| `dayTitle` | `"EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy"` | Day-scale title and Today tooltip. |
| `timeGutter` | `"h a"` | Day-scale axis unit labels. |
| `eventTime` | `"h:mm a"` | Timed event time labels. |

`functions` are the composed formatters. The defaults are re-bound to the merged `labels`/`formats`
on every merge, so overriding a format string (for example `formats.eventTime`) reaches the default
renderers without also replacing the function:

| Property | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `formatTitle` | `(scale, ctx: { date, activeRange, visibleRange, locale? }) => string` | The nav title per scale (week gets a smart range label). |
| `formatEventTime` | `(start: Date, end: Date, allDay: boolean, locale?: Locale) => string` | Bar time/range labels; all-day bars show their date range. |
| `formatDayRange` | `(range: GanttDateRange, locale?: Locale) => string` | Compact day-range label. |
| `formatEventAriaLabel` | `(parts: { title, timeLabel, milestoneLabel?, rowTitle?, progressLabel?, plannedLabel?, continues: boolean }) => string` | Composes the bar screen-reader label; appends `labels.continues` when clipped. |

## Base UI vs Radix UI

Detect your build from `components.json` -> `style`: `base-nova` -> Base UI (this file's default),
`radix-nova` -> Radix UI.

| | Base UI | Radix UI |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @reui/gantt` | (same name; the registry resolves the build from `components.json`) |
| Composition idiom on every `Gantt*` nav/root/toolbar/view/bar component's customization prop | `render={...}` (a `useRender.RenderProp`) | `asChild: boolean` (default `false`, "Render the child element instead (Radix `Slot`)") |

Confirmed by diff of the two mirrored pages: every occurrence of a `render` row in the Base UI API
tables (`Gantt`, `GanttNav`, `GanttNavToday`, `GanttNavPrev`, `GanttNavNext`, `GanttTitle`,
`GanttScaleSwitcher`, `GanttToolbar`, `GanttView`, `GanttBar`) becomes an `asChild` row in the Radix
UI page, same position, same default `false`. The flagship demo also swaps `PopoverTrigger
render={<Button .../>}` (Base UI) for `PopoverTrigger asChild><Button ...>` (Radix UI), and the
Base UI settings-menu `Select`/`SelectValue` explicitly renders
`<SelectValue>{options.find(...)?.label}</SelectValue>` ("Base UI's Value renders the raw value
string by default; the selected option's label reads better here") where Radix uses a bare
`<SelectValue />`.

Every other table on the page — `GanttEvent`, `GanttResource`, all state options, all callbacks, all
view configuration props, `GanttInteractions`, `GanttOffDaysConfig`, `GanttTreePanelConfig`,
`GanttColumn`, `GanttMetrics`, `GanttActivationConfig`, `GanttClassNames`, and the full
Internationalization section — is identical text between the two builds.
