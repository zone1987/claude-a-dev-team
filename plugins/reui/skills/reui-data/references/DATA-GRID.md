# Data Grid

Custom Shadcn Data Grid for React and Tailwind CSS. A powerful TanStack Table v9 data grid with
sorting, filtering, pagination, footer rows, drag-and-drop, row and column virtualization, infinite
scroll, row pinning, tree rows, spreadsheet-style cell selection with clipboard and inline editing,
and localized labels through one i18n prop.

Free component — no licence key required. This primitive also powers 37 ready-made ReUI Pro blocks
(complete data grid sections built on top of this component); those blocks are premium and out of
scope for this reference.

The current `data-grid` package ships the shared grid context, table renderers, pagination, column
controls, drag-and-drop helpers, virtualization, infinite scroll, footer helpers, row-pinning
support, tree rows, and spreadsheet-style cell selection with clipboard and editing support
(`data-grid-cell-selection.tsx`). Footer components (`DataGridTableFoot`, `DataGridTableFootRow`,
`DataGridTableFootRowCell`) plus the `DataGridTableRowPin` and `DataGridTableRowExpand` toggles are
exported from `data-grid-table.tsx`.

In the base build, `data-grid-scroll-area.tsx` is also included and exports `DataGridScrollArea` for
dedicated scroll handling around sticky-header or wide tables.

## Installation

```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @reui/data-grid
```

(npm/yarn/bun equivalents: `npx shadcn@latest add @reui/data-grid`, `yarn dlx shadcn@latest add
@reui/data-grid`, `bunx shadcn@latest add @reui/data-grid`.)

## TanStack Table v9

The data grid is built on TanStack Table v9. v9 asks every table to declare which features it uses,
so the grid exports a ready-made bundle:

```tsx
import { useTable } from "@tanstack/react-table"
import { dataGridFeatures } from "@/components/reui/data-grid"

const table = useTable({
  features: dataGridFeatures,
  columns,
  data,
  state: { sorting, pagination },
  onSortingChange: setSorting,
  onPaginationChange: setPagination,
})
```

`dataGridFeatures` registers everything the grid's own rendering needs, which is a wider set than it
looks. `columnVisibilityFeature` gates `row.getVisibleCells()` and `columnPinningFeature` gates the
`getStartVisibleCells()` / `getCenterVisibleCells()` / `getEndVisibleCells()` split every row goes
through, so a grid that never hides and never pins a column still needs both just to render rows.

Two entries in the bundle are neither features nor row models:

- `sortFns`, which registers every built-in v9 ships: `alphanumeric`, `alphanumericCaseSensitive`,
  `basic`, `datetime`, `text` and `textCaseSensitive`. On v9 a string `sortFn` resolves against this
  registry alone, and the default `sortFn: "auto"` infers one of those names from the first row's
  value, so the map has to be complete or an ordinary string column warns in development and falls
  back to unsorted order. Register a custom comparator by extending the bundle with
  `tableFeatures({ ...dataGridFeatures, sortFns: { ... } })`, or pass a function directly as
  `sortFn`.
- `columnMeta`, which types `columnDef.meta` as `DataGridColumnMeta` (`headerTitle`,
  `headerClassName`, `cellClassName`, `skeleton`, `expandedContent`, `autoSize`, `fillWidth`,
  `cellEdit`). A features-level `columnMeta` slot wins over the global `ColumnMeta` interface, so the
  v8 `declare module` augmentation is ignored on any table built with `dataGridFeatures`. Add your
  own fields to `DataGridColumnMeta` in the installed `data-grid.tsx` instead.

The bundle also ships as a type, `DataGridFeatures`. v9 puts the feature set first in the TanStack
generics, so that is the type you write wherever a column, a row or the table appears in your own
annotations:

```tsx
import type { ColumnDef, Row } from "@tanstack/react-table"
import type { DataGridFeatures } from "@/components/reui/data-grid"

const columns: ColumnDef<DataGridFeatures, IData>[] = [
  // ...
]

function ActionsCell({ row }: { row: Row<DataGridFeatures, IData> }) {
  // ...
}
```

If you build your own bundle instead, annotate against that one (`typeof features`) rather than
`DataGridFeatures`.

You still own the table. `<DataGrid>` accepts any feature bundle, so extend it when a grid needs
more:

```tsx
const features = tableFeatures({
  ...dataGridFeatures,
  columnGroupingFeature,
  groupedRowModel: createGroupedRowModel(),
})
```

or hand over a leaner one of your own when you want a smaller bundle. One dependency to keep:
`cellSelectionFeature` gates the whole spreadsheet layer, and with a bundle that omits it
`tableLayout.cellSelection` is silently inert (both the controller and the cell renderer check
`table.atoms.cellSelection`, not the flag). `<DataGrid>` is the generic one: its `table` prop is
`Table<TFeatures, TData>` for any `TFeatures`, and the instance is widened internally exactly once.
The sub-components that take a `column`, `row` or `table` prop (`DataGridColumnHeader`,
`DataGridColumnFilter`, `DataGridColumnVisibility`, `DataGridTableRowSelect`,
`DataGridTableRowPin`, `DataGridTableRowExpand`) are declared against `DataGridFeatures`, and
`TFeatures` is invariant in v9, so any bundle that is wider or leaner than `dataGridFeatures` needs a
cast at those boundaries.

## Prompt for TanStack Table v9 migration

If you already have the Data Grid installed, paste the prompt below into your coding agent. It
covers both cases: a session with the ReUI MCP connected, and a plain project where the primitive is
reinstalled from the registry.

```
Migrate ReUI Data Grid to TanStack Table v9.

STEP 1 - Replace the Data Grid primitive from the registry.

  Case A, the ReUI MCP is available in this session:
    - Call search("data-grid"), then get_component("data-grid") to read the current API.
    - Call get_examples("data-grid") to see real composition.
    - Run the command returned by get_install_command("data-grid") and overwrite when prompted.

  Case B, no ReUI MCP:
    - Run: npx shadcn@latest add @reui/data-grid
    - Answer yes when asked to overwrite the existing files.

  Every data-grid file must come from the registry. Do not hand-patch them, do not merge
  them by hand, and do not keep a local fork of any of them.

STEP 2 - Move to TanStack Table v9 and confirm v8 is gone.

  - Set "@tanstack/react-table" to "^9.0.0" in package.json.
  - Reinstall (npm install, pnpm install or yarn).
  - Do not continue until all three checks pass:
      1. package.json lists "@tanstack/react-table": "^9.0.0" and no other version of it.
      2. The installed version is 9.x. Run: npm ls @tanstack/react-table
      3. No v8 copy survives in the lockfile. Search the lockfile for "react-table" and
         confirm every resolved version is 9.x. If an 8.x entry remains, another dependency
         is pulling it in: dedupe or upgrade that package.
  - This matters because v9 removed useReactTable entirely. A leftover v8 install under v9
    code fails as an unresolved import, not as a helpful error.

STEP 3 - Update every table you own.

  - useReactTable({ ... }) becomes useTable({ features: dataGridFeatures, ... }), importing
    dataGridFeatures from your installed data-grid.
  - Delete the getCoreRowModel / getSortedRowModel / getFilteredRowModel /
    getPaginationRowModel options. dataGridFeatures already registers them.
  - If a grid used to render every row, add manualPagination: true. The v9 paginated row
    model always slices, so that grid would otherwise show only the first page.
  - Add the leading TFeatures generic to types: ColumnDef<TData, TValue> becomes
    ColumnDef<DataGridFeatures, TData, TValue>. Same for Row, Column, Cell, Header, Table.
  - Column pinning is start/end, never left/right: ColumnPinningState, column.pin(),
    getIsPinned(), and any CSS matching [data-pinned="left"].
  - Renames: table.getState() becomes table.state, VisibilityState becomes
    ColumnVisibilityState, sortingFn becomes sortFn, columnSizingInfo becomes columnResizing.
  - Indeterminate header checkbox: use
    getIsSomePageRowsSelected() && !getIsAllPageRowsSelected().
  - Column meta comes from the exported DataGridColumnMeta. Delete any
    declare module "@tanstack/react-table" augmentation you added.
  - Remove "use no memo" from files that only wrap the grid.
  - State shapes got stricter: ColumnPinningState requires both start and end,
    RowPinningState requires both top and bottom, and RowSelectionState narrowed to
    Record<string, true>, so deselecting by writing false no longer type-checks.

STEP 4 - Prove the migration is complete.

  Search the whole project. Every one of these must return zero results:
    useReactTable
    getCoreRowModel
    data-pinned="left"
    table.getState(
    declare module "@tanstack/react-table"
  Any hit is a call site you missed.

STEP 5 - Verify it actually runs.

  Typecheck must pass with no errors. Then open each grid and confirm: sorting, paging,
  column visibility, pinning a column to each side while scrolling horizontally, row
  selection including the header checkbox, and column resizing.
```

## React Compiler

TanStack Table v8 returned a stable table instance whose state mutated internally, so React Compiler
memoized reads against a reference that never changed and state updates could be skipped. That is
what the `"use no memo"` directive worked around, and on v9 it is no longer needed here: `useTable`
returns a fresh table reference on every state change, which is exactly the signal the compiler
needs.

One gap remains, and the grid already handles it for you. State is not only read through `table`, it
is also read through builder calls like `row.getIsSelected()` and `column.getIsPinned()`. Those hide
their dependency from the compiler, and when a header or cell is rendered by a nested component
holding a stable row or column, the compiler can memoize that JSX and never re-run the read. ReUI
wraps its own such reads — the selection checkboxes and the column header — in TanStack's
`Subscribe`, so sort arrows, pin controls and checkboxes stay live.

What you must do. If your own `cell` or `header` template is a named child component that reads
state through a builder call, subscribe there too:

```tsx
import { Subscribe } from "@tanstack/react-table"

cell: ({ row }) => (
  <Subscribe source={row.table.atoms.rowSelection}>
    {() => <MyCheckbox checked={row.getIsSelected()} />}
  </Subscribe>
)
```

Note the standalone `Subscribe` rather than `table.Subscribe`: inside a column definition the
`table` you receive is typed as the core `Table` from `@tanstack/table-core`, and only the
`ReactTable` that `useTable` returns declares `Subscribe`, so `row.table.Subscribe` does not
type-check.

The same rule applies to cell selection: a custom cell template reading `cell.getIsSelected()`,
`cell.getIsFocused()` or `cell.getSelectionEdges()` must subscribe to `row.table.atoms.cellSelection`,
the same shape as the row-selection snippet above. The grid's own cell renderer already does this for
the attributes it paints.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useTable, type ColumnDef } from "@tanstack/react-table"
import {
  DataGrid,
  DataGridContainer,
  dataGridFeatures,
  DataGridPagination,
  DataGridTable,
  DataGridTableFootRow,
  DataGridTableFootRowCell,
  type DataGridFeatures,
} from "@/components/reui/data-grid"
```

```tsx
const columns: ColumnDef<DataGridFeatures, User>[] = [
  { accessorKey: "name", header: "Name" },
  { accessorKey: "email", header: "Email" },
]

const footer = (
  <DataGridTableFootRow>
    <DataGridTableFootRowCell colSpan={columns.length}>
      Showing {data.length} rows
    </DataGridTableFootRowCell>
  </DataGridTableFootRow>
)

const table = useTable({
  features: dataGridFeatures,
  data,
  columns,
})

return (
  <DataGrid
    table={table}
    recordCount={data.length}
    tableLayout={{ rowsPinnable: true }}
  >
    <DataGridContainer>
      <DataGridTable footerContent={footer} />
    </DataGridContainer>
    <DataGridPagination />
  </DataGrid>
)
```

Use `DataGridTableRowPin` inside a column definition to let users pin rows, swap in
`DataGridTableVirtual` when you need virtualization or infinite scroll, and wrap sticky-header
tables with `DataGridScrollArea` when you want the dedicated base scroll wrapper. When rows can be
pinned or virtualized, provide a stable `getRowId` so row identity stays intact across reordering.

## Examples

The docs page names 10 examples with "Copy"/"View Code" affordances; only 3 carry a printed
description in the mirrored markdown (the rest are heading-only, no prose, no inline code):

| Example | What the page says |
|---|---|
| Cell Border | heading only |
| Dense Table | heading only |
| Light Table | heading only |
| Striped Table | heading only |
| Auto Width | heading only |
| Row Selection | heading only |
| Tree Rows | heading only |
| Spreadsheet Editing | Cell range selection, clipboard copy/cut/paste with Excel and Google Sheets round-trip, a fill handle, inline editors, and a bulk edit bar over row selection, all in one grid alongside sorting, pagination, resizable and pinned columns. |
| Column Virtualization | 36 metric columns over 1,000 rows with both axes virtualized: only the horizontal window of center columns is in the DOM, the pinned edge columns stay mounted, and the header buttons jump the window through `scrollToColumnIndex`. |
| Localized Labels | One `i18n` prop swaps every built-in string, so the header menu, the row select and pagination aria labels, and the pagination copy follow the language switch. The column titles and cell text stay the consumer's own, alongside a locale-aware `Intl.NumberFormat`. |
| Server Side Pagination | The end-to-end pattern for a grid backed by a large server-side dataset: the table holds exactly one page, and pagination, sorting, and a debounced search are sent to the server, which returns the page plus the total after filtering. The demo simulates the server with an in-file async function over 487 records; replace its body with a fetch to your own API and keep the return shape. The contract that makes the controls work: pass the server-side total twice — `rowCount` on `useTable` drives `table.getPageCount()`, so the page buttons know how many pages exist beyond the loaded rows; `recordCount` on `DataGrid` drives the "1 - 5 of 487" info text. With `manualPagination` and only `recordCount` set, the info text claims the full count while the buttons collapse to a single page. `isLoading` renders the built-in skeleton rows during each fetch, and a request id guard keeps a slow response from overwriting a newer one. |

None of the ten examples print inline source on this mirrored page (all show only "Copy"/"View Code"
placeholders in the markdown extraction). A single full worked demo (the DOM Attributes section's
closing example, spreadsheet-editing style with a toast) does appear in full — see
[DATA-GRID-EXAMPLE.md](./DATA-GRID-EXAMPLE.md).

For the full set of variations (expandable rows, sub-grids, tree rows, sortable / movable /
draggable / resizable / pinnable columns, sticky header, column controls and visibility, loading
skeleton, CRUD in frame, footer totals / summary / aggregates, infinite scroll, server side
pagination, row pinning, and spreadsheet editing) browse the Data Grid components page — not
reproduced in the mirrored markdown.

## API Reference

### DataGrid

The root component that provides the table context.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `table` | `Table` | — | Required. The TanStack Table instance. |
| `recordCount` | `number` | — | Required. Total number of records. Drives the pagination info text only; with `manualPagination`, also pass the same total to `useTable` as `rowCount` so `table.getPageCount()` sees it. |
| `isLoading` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether the table is in a loading state. |
| `loadingMode` | `"skeleton" \| "spinner"` | `"skeleton"` | The visual style of the loading state. |
| `loadingMessage` | `ReactNode \| string` | `"Loading..."` | Message to display when `loadingMode` is `"spinner"`. |
| `fetchingMoreMessage` | `ReactNode \| string` | `loadingMessage` | Message to display while `DataGridTableVirtual` is fetching more rows. |
| `allRowsLoadedMessage` | `ReactNode \| string` | `"All records loaded"` | Message to display when virtual infinite scroll reaches the end. |
| `emptyMessage` | `ReactNode \| string` | `"No data available"` | Message to display when the table is empty. |
| `onRowClick` | `(row: TData) => void` | — | Callback function triggered when a row is clicked. |
| `onCellsChange` | `(details: DataGridCellsChangeDetails) => void` | — | Receives every spreadsheet write batch (paste, cut, clear, fill, edit). See [DataGridCellSelection](#datagridcellselection). |
| `onCellEditRequest` | `(request: DataGridCellEditRequest) => void` | — | Opens your editor from the keyboard: Enter, F2, or typing on the focused cell. See [DataGridCellSelection](#datagridcellselection). |
| `onCellSelectionChange` | `(snapshot: DataGridCellSelectionSnapshot) => void` | — | Fires on every selection change with the focused cell, the bounds, the active bound and the visible cell count, so a count or formula bar needs no TanStack internals. |
| `onCellsCopy` | `(details: DataGridCopyDetails) => void` | — | Fires after the grid writes the clipboard (Cmd/Ctrl+C or X, native copy or cut) with the text, the grid of fields and a cut flag, e.g. to confirm with a toast. |
| `i18n` | `DataGridI18nOverrides` | — | Overrides for every built-in string; see [Internationalization](#internationalization) below. |
| `onRowCreate` | `() => void` | — | Renders an "Add row" affordance as the body's last row; the click is your cue to append a row. |
| `rowCreateLabel` | `ReactNode` | `"Add row"` | Label of the `onRowCreate` affordance, e.g. for localization. |
| `appendRow` | `ReactNode` | — | Rows rendered after the data rows and before the add-row affordance, e.g. a custom draft row; the keyboard walks into them with ArrowDown. |
| `getRowStatus` | `(row: TData) => "new" \| "dirty" \| "deleted" \| undefined` | — | Optional CRUD indication per row: tints and, for deleted, mutes and strikes. |
| `getCellStatus` | `(row: TData, columnId: string) => "dirty" \| "invalid" \| undefined` | — | Optional per-cell corner mark for edited or invalid cells. |
| `tableLayout` | `DataGridTableLayout` | — | Configuration for table layout and features (table below). |
| `tableClassNames` | `DataGridTableClassNames` | — | Custom CSS classes for various table parts. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes for the root grid component. |

`DataGridTableLayout` (the `tableLayout` prop's shape):

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dense` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to use dense padding for cells. |
| `cellBorder` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to show vertical borders between cells. |
| `rowBorder` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to show horizontal borders between rows. |
| `rowRounded` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to add rounded corners to rows. |
| `stripped` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to use zebra-striping for rows. |
| `headerBackground` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to show a background color for the header. |
| `footerBackground` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to show a background color for footer rows. |
| `headerBorder` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to show a border below the header. |
| `headerSticky` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether the header should be sticky during scroll. With pinned columns, give the class `z-40`: pinned body cells are sticky at z-30 and a lower band lets them paint over the header; the pinned header cells themselves pin both axes automatically. |
| `width` | `"auto" \| "fixed"` | `"fixed"` | The table layout algorithm (`table-auto` vs `table-fixed`). |
| `columnsVisibility` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables column visibility toggling. |
| `columnsResizable` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables column resizing. |
| `columnsResizeMode` | `"onChange" \| "onEnd"` | `"onEnd"` | When a column resize is committed. |
| `columnsPinnable` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables column pinning. |
| `columnsMovable` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables moving columns via menu. |
| `columnsDraggable` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables drag-and-drop for columns. |
| `rowsDraggable` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables drag-and-drop for rows. |
| `rowsPinnable` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables row pinning (top/bottom). |
| `cellSelection` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables spreadsheet cell range selection and its chrome. |
| `cellSelectionMode` | `"single" \| "range"` | `"range"` | `"single"` collapses every grow gesture (drag, Shift, Ctrl/Cmd, Shift+keys) to one focused cell, and Ctrl/Cmd+A is inert. |
| `cellFillHandle` | `boolean` | `false` | Renders the drag-to-fill handle on the selection corner. Requires `cellSelection`. |
| `cellFillHandleVariant` | `"dot" \| "ring" \| "square"` | `"dot"` | Handle look: a solid dot or an Excel-style square inside the corner, or the Sheets-style hollow ring riding the corner point; the ring straddles the corner and clamps back inside at the grid's boundary, while dot and square sit inside the cell and need no clamps. |
| `cellEditMode` | `"dblclick" \| "click"` | `"dblclick"` | How the mouse opens an editor: the spreadsheet standard (first click focuses, second edits), or single-click editing; modifier clicks and drags still select. |
| `cellEditEnterAdvance` | `boolean` | `false` | Enter-commit moves down and Shift+Enter up, the Sheets flow. Off, a commit keeps focus on the edited cell; Tab always commits and moves across. |

`columnsResizeMode` is resolved by the grid, not by TanStack. Left unset, the grid reads the table's
own `columnResizeMode` and falls back to `"onEnd"` when that is undefined, which on v9 is the normal
case: `useTable` hands back the options object you passed, so feature defaults never show up on
`table.options`.

### DataGridTableClassNames

Custom CSS classes for different parts of the table.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `base` | `string` | — | CSS classes for the `<table>` element. |
| `header` | `string` | — | CSS classes for the `<thead>` element. |
| `headerRow` | `string` | — | CSS classes for header rows. |
| `headerSticky` | `string` | — | CSS classes for sticky header state. |
| `body` | `string` | — | CSS classes for the `<tbody>` element. |
| `bodyRow` | `string` | — | CSS classes for body rows. |
| `footer` | `string` | — | CSS classes for the `<tfoot>` element. |
| `edgeCell` | `string` | — | CSS classes for the first and last cells in a row. |
| `rowNew` | `string` | — | Overrides the `getRowStatus` "new" tint (default: green muted). |
| `rowDirty` | `string` | — | Overrides the `getRowStatus` "dirty" tint (default: warning muted). |
| `rowDeleted` | `string` | — | Overrides the `getRowStatus` "deleted" treatment (default: destructive muted, struck). |
| `rowPinned` | `string` | — | Overrides the pinned-row chrome (muted tint, boundary shadow), e.g. so a pinned create-draft reads as an active row. |
| `rowCreate` | `string` | — | The `onRowCreate` affordance row, e.g. `[&_button]:h-11` to match the grid's row height. |
| `cellFillHandle` | `string` | — | The fill handle, e.g. to restyle or resize it beyond the built-in variants. |

### DataGridContainer

The outer wrapper for the grid. It clips overflow, so scrolling comes from `DataGridScrollArea`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Required. The grid content to wrap. |
| `border` | `boolean` | — | Accepted for backwards compatibility and currently has no effect. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes for the container. |

### DataGridScrollArea

Dedicated scroll wrapper for wide grids and sticky headers.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Required. The grid content to wrap. |
| `orientation` | `"horizontal" \| "vertical" \| "both"` | `"both"` | Which scrollbars to render. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes for the wrapper. |

While the sticky-header scroll mode is active (`headerSticky` with a vertical orientation), the root
carries `data-overflow-vertical="true"` whenever content overflows vertically. Use it as an ancestor
selector to style scrollable vs short grids, for example a closing bottom border on the last row only
when a fixed-height grid is partially filled:
`[[data-slot=data-grid-scroll-area]:not([data-overflow-vertical])_&:last-child>td]:border-b` on
`tableClassNames.bodyRow`.

### DataGridTable

The component that renders the actual HTML table. It automatically handles data rendering, loading
states (skeletons/spinners), empty states, footer rows, and pinned rows when `rowsPinnable` is
enabled on the parent `DataGrid`. The unpinned rows come from `table.getRowModel()`, which on v9
resolves to the paginated row model, and `dataGridFeatures` always registers `paginatedRowModel`, so
a grid that must render every row sets `manualPagination: true` on `useTable`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `footerContent` | `ReactNode` | — | Optional footer content rendered inside `<tfoot>`. |
| `renderHeader` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to render the table header. |

### DataGridPagination

The component for table pagination controls. The record info comes from the `recordCount` prop on
`DataGrid`, and the page buttons come from `table.getPageCount()`, so they only render when there is
more than one page. In v9 `getPageCount()` is `pageCount ?? Math.ceil(rowCount / pageSize)` and
`rowCount` falls back to the pre-paginated row count, so a grid whose `data` holds only the current
page must pass `rowCount` or `pageCount` to `useTable` or the buttons never appear.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sizes` | `number[]` | `[5, 10, 25, 50, 100]` | Array of available page sizes. |
| `sizesSkeleton` | `ReactNode` | default skeleton | Placeholder shown instead of the page size selector while `isLoading` is set. |
| `rowsPerPageLabel` | `string` | `"Rows per page"` | Visible label rendered next to the page size selector. |
| `info` | `string` | `"{from} - {to} of {count}"` | Template for the record info. `{count}` is `recordCount`. |
| `infoSkeleton` | `ReactNode` | default skeleton | Placeholder shown instead of the record info while `isLoading` is set. |
| `moreLimit` | `number` | `5` | The number of page buttons to show before truncating. |
| `previousPageLabel` | `string` | `"Go to previous page"` | Accessible label for the previous page button. |
| `nextPageLabel` | `string` | `"Go to next page"` | Accessible label for the next page button. |
| `ellipsisText` | `string` | `"..."` | Text to display for the ellipsis button. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes for the pagination container. |

`sizesInfo`, `sizesLabel`, `sizesDescription` and `more` are still accepted by
`DataGridPaginationProps` but are not rendered.

### DataGridColumnHeader

(Unnamed heading on the upstream page; its prop table follows immediately after `DataGridPagination`
and precedes `DataGridColumnFilter`.)

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `column` | `Column` | — | Required. The TanStack Column instance. |
| `title` | `string` | — | Header label. Falls back to `columnDef.meta.headerTitle`, then a string `columnDef.header`, then `column.id`. |
| `icon` | `ReactNode` | — | Optional icon to display next to the title. |
| `filter` | `ReactNode` | — | Optional filter component to display in the header menu. |
| `visibility` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to include column visibility controls in the menu. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes for the header label or trigger button. |

### DataGridColumnFilter

(Unnamed heading on the upstream page; its prop table follows `DataGridColumnHeader`'s and precedes
`DataGridColumnVisibility`.)

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `column` | `Column` | — | The TanStack Column instance to filter. |
| `title` | `string` | — | The title for the filter trigger and placeholder. |
| `options` | `Array<{ label, value, ... }>` | — | Required. The list of options to filter by. |

The count beside each option comes from `column.getFacetedUniqueValues()`. On v9 that method only
exists when the feature bundle registers `columnFacetingFeature`: leave the feature out of a leaner
bundle of your own and the call throws, because the method is never added to the column. The numbers
themselves come from the `facetedUniqueValues` row model, and without it the method still answers,
with an empty map, so the counts quietly vanish. `facetedRowModel` is what makes those counts respect
the table's other active filters instead of the unfiltered rows. `dataGridFeatures` registers all
three, so the counts work out of the box.

Filtering needs one thing more. v9 resolves a string `filterFn` name against the `filterFns` map on
the feature bundle, including the default `'auto'`, and `dataGridFeatures` registers none, so hand
the column a filter function directly:

```tsx
import { filterFn_arrHas } from "@tanstack/react-table"

const columns = [
  {
    accessorKey: "status",
    header: "Status",
    filterFn: filterFn_arrHas,
  },
]
```

This filter writes an array of selected values, and `filterFn_arrHas` matches a scalar cell value
against that array (reach for `filterFn_arrIncludesSome` when the cell itself holds an array).
Without a function the value still lands in `columnFilters`, no row is ever filtered, and v9 warns in
development that the filter function is not registered. The alternative is to register the names you
want in your own bundle through the `filterFns` slot, the way `dataGridFeatures` registers `sortFns`.

### DataGridColumnVisibility

(Unnamed heading on the upstream page; its prop table follows `DataGridColumnFilter`'s and precedes
`DataGridTableDnd`.)

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `table` | `Table` | — | Required. The TanStack Table instance. |
| `trigger` | `ReactElement<any>` | — | Required. The trigger element for the visibility menu. |

### DataGridTableDnd

Used for enabling column drag-and-drop reordering with optional footer rendering.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `handleDragEnd` | `(event: DragEndEvent) => void` | — | Required. Callback triggered when a column drag operation ends. |
| `footerContent` | `ReactNode` | — | Optional footer content rendered inside `<tfoot>`. |

The sortable items come from `table.state.columnOrder`, and TanStack starts that slice as an empty
array, so you have to seed it and keep it controlled. Give every column an explicit `id`:
`ColumnDef.id` is optional and is only derived from `accessorKey` on the built column, not on the
definition object you map over.

```tsx
const [columnOrder, setColumnOrder] = useState<string[]>(() =>
  columns.map((column) => column.id as string)
)

const handleDragEnd = ({ active, over }: DragEndEvent) => {
  if (!over || active.id === over.id) return
  setColumnOrder((order) =>
    arrayMove(
      order,
      order.indexOf(active.id as string),
      order.indexOf(over.id as string)
    )
  )
}

const table = useTable({
  features: dataGridFeatures,
  columns,
  data,
  state: { columnOrder },
  onColumnOrderChange: setColumnOrder,
})
```

Leave `columnOrder` empty and the headers never resolve a position inside the sortable context, so
the columns do not shift during the gesture and `arrayMove` runs against an empty array, which
commits nothing. The slice is read as `table.state.columnOrder` on v9, where v8 used
`table.getState().columnOrder`; `setColumnOrder`, `onColumnOrderChange` and `ColumnOrderState` keep
their v8 names and shape.

### DataGridTableDndRows

Used for enabling row drag-and-drop reordering with optional footer rendering.

Reordering is yours to commit: the grid carries a clone of the row you picked up and marks the seam
it would land on, then hands you `handleDragEnd` to write the new order back. Three things have to
line up, and a reorder that silently does nothing is almost always one of them:

- `getRowId` must be stable and match `dataIds`. dnd-kit identifies rows by `row.id`, so `dataIds`
  has to be the same ids in the same order as the rendered rows. Deriving both from the record's own
  id is the reliable pattern.
- Reorder by replacing `data`, not by mutating it. TanStack reprocesses rows when the `data`
  reference changes, so an in-place `splice` leaves the grid showing the old order.
- Do not read a stale index. Resolve positions from the current data inside the state updater.

```tsx
const [data, setData] = useState(rows)
const dataIds = useMemo(() => data.map(({ id }) => id), [data])

const handleDragEnd = ({ active, over }: DragEndEvent) => {
  if (!over || active.id === over.id) return
  setData((current) => {
    const from = current.findIndex((row) => row.id === active.id)
    const to = current.findIndex((row) => row.id === over.id)
    return from === -1 || to === -1 ? current : arrayMove(current, from, to)
  })
}

const table = useTable({
  features: dataGridFeatures,
  // dataGridFeatures registers a paginated row model, and that model always
  // slices to pageSize (10 by default). manualPagination says the data is
  // already the page, so every row renders and stays reorderable.
  manualPagination: true,
  columns,
  data,
  getRowId: (row) => row.id,
})
```

The drag handle comes from `DataGridTableDndRowHandle` in a column of your own. It reads the row's
sortable context, so it only works inside the rows this component renders; placed anywhere else it
renders as a disabled grip. It also takes `className`, plus a `disabled` flag and a `disabledLabel`
(default `"Reordering unavailable"`) for the cases where reordering is genuinely off, a sort being
the usual one: the grip keeps its place in the gutter and reads as unavailable instead of vanishing
and collapsing the column.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dataIds` | `UniqueIdentifier[]` | — | Required. Array of unique identifiers for the current page data. |
| `handleDragEnd` | `(event: DragEndEvent) => void` | — | Required. Callback triggered when a row drag operation ends. |
| `footerContent` | `ReactNode` | — | Optional footer content rendered inside `<tfoot>`. |
| `collisionDetection` | `CollisionDetection` | `closestCenter` | Overrides the dnd-kit collision strategy. |
| `modifiers` | `Modifier[]` | `[restrictToVerticalAxis]` | Replaces the default axis restriction. The vertical clamp to the table container is always applied after these. The horizontal one is dropped so a tree drag can read `x`. |
| `sortingStrategy` | `SortingStrategy` | hold in place | Replaces the strategy that holds every row where it is. Pass `verticalListSortingStrategy` for the classic sliding gap. |
| `renderRowDecoration` | `(context) => ReactNode` | — | Per-row slot for drop indicators and depth guides. Receives `{ row, isDragging, isOver }`. |
| `dropIndicator` | `boolean` | `true` | Marks the drop target with a bar down its leading edge. Turn off when `renderRowDecoration` paints its own. |
| `onDragStart` | `(event: DragStartEvent) => void` | — | Forwarded from the drag context, after the internal drag state updates. |
| `onDragMove` | `(event: DragMoveEvent) => void` | — | Forwarded from the drag context. |
| `onDragOver` | `(event: DragOverEvent) => void` | — | Forwarded from the drag context. |
| `onDragCancel` | `(event: DragCancelEvent) => void` | — | Forwarded from the drag context, after the internal drag state resets. |

While a row is in flight the grid does four things, and all of them are built in:

- The carried row is a clone, measured from the row it was lifted from — its column widths and its
  height. It is not a fixed size, so a grid with wrapping cells or dense rows does not appear to grow
  under the pointer when you pick a row up.
- The rows hold still. Sliding them apart to open a gap reads well in a list of identical rows and
  badly in a table: the gap is the height of the row you are holding, so with rows of unequal height
  it never matches the slot it claims to be, and the row you picked up slides away from where it
  started. Pass `verticalListSortingStrategy` as `sortingStrategy` for the old behaviour.
- The row you picked up stays where it was, dimmed and outlined. It is the slot you are moving out
  of, so it is still there to return to if you change your mind mid-drag.
- The drop target is marked with a 2px bar down its leading edge, the same marker the tree drag uses.
  Since nothing moves, the bar is the only thing that says where the row lands, and `data-edge` says
  which side of that row it comes to rest on.

The indicator renders as a plain element inside the last cell, never a `td` of its own, so it adds no
column and cannot disturb `table-layout: fixed`. Target it with
`[data-slot="data-grid-table-row-drop-indicator"]`; it carries `data-edge="top" | "bottom"` for the
side the row would land on, so you can style your own seam from it.

Every sortable row carries tree metadata, so any drag event can resolve a target without re-deriving
the table shape:

```tsx
type DataGridTableDndRowData = {
  type: "data-grid-row"
  depth: number
  index: number
  parentId: string | null
}

// in onDragOver / handleDragEnd
const active = event.active.data.current as DataGridTableDndRowData
const over = event.over?.data.current as DataGridTableDndRowData | undefined
```

Together these cover cross-parent (re-parenting) drops: drop `restrictToVerticalAxis` from
`modifiers` so a horizontal gesture can express a depth change, track the intended parent and depth
in `onDragMove` or `onDragOver`, paint the target with `renderRowDecoration`, and commit the move in
`handleDragEnd`. The decoration node is positioned over the row, so it adds no column and does not
disturb striping; give it `absolute` placement, for example an `inset-x-0 bottom-0 h-0.5 bg-primary`
line offset by the target depth.

### Internationalization

Every built-in string — the header menu items, aria labels for row pin / select / expand and the
drag handles, the pagination copy, the loading, empty and end-of-list states, and the faceted
filter's texts — is replaceable in one place through `i18n` on `DataGrid`. Labels that interpolate
are functions, so pluralization and word order live in the label rather than in string
concatenation:

```tsx
<DataGrid
  i18n={{
    labels: {
      sortAscending: "Aufsteigend",
      pinColumnStart: "Links anheften",
      rowsPerPage: "Zeilen pro Seite",
      paginationInfo: ({ from, to, count }) => `${from}-${to} von ${count}`,
      goToPage: (page) => `Seite ${page}`,
    },
  }}
>
```

The merge is shallow per section: untouched keys keep their defaults, and a more specific component
prop that predates `i18n` (`rowCreateLabel`, `loadingMessage`, `emptyMessage`, the
`DataGridPagination` label props, the row-DnD `disabledLabel`) still wins over its `i18n`
counterpart, so adopting `i18n` is never a breaking change. The full key set with defaults ships in
`data-grid-i18n.tsx`; `DataGridI18nLabels`, `DataGridI18nConfig`, `DataGridI18nOverrides` and
`mergeDataGridI18n` are exported from it.

### DataGridTableVirtual

A virtualized table renderer using `@tanstack/react-virtual` for row virtualization, infinite
scroll, optional footer rows, and pinned rows when `rowsPinnable` is enabled. The wrapper manages row
count and the scroll element for you, while `virtualizerOptions` lets you customize the underlying
TanStack Virtual instance. Set `scrollToRowIndex` to reveal a controlled center row; `"auto"`
alignment keeps already-visible rows in place and accounts for sticky headers.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `height` | `number \| string` | — | Optional fixed height when not using an outer scroll container. |
| `estimateSize` | `number` | `48` | Estimated row height in pixels for the virtualizer. |
| `overscan` | `number` | `10` | Number of rows to render outside the visible area. |
| `scrollBehavior` | `ScrollBehavior` | `"auto"` | Scroll animation used when revealing `scrollToRowIndex`. |
| `scrollToRowAlign` | `"auto" \| "center" \| "start" \| "end"` | `"auto"` | Alignment used when revealing the target row. `"auto"` only scrolls when the row is outside the visible area. |
| `scrollToRowIndex` | `number` | — | Index within the center (non-pinned) row section to reveal. Supports custom scroll elements and disabled virtualization. |
| `footerContent` | `ReactNode` | — | Optional footer content rendered inside `<tfoot>`. |
| `renderHeader` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to render the table header. |
| `onFetchMore` | `() => void` | — | Callback triggered when user scrolls near the bottom. |
| `isFetchingMore` | `boolean` | — | Whether additional data is currently being loaded. |
| `hasMore` | `boolean` | — | Whether there are more records available to fetch. |
| `fetchMoreOffset` | `number` | `0` | How many rows before the end should trigger `onFetchMore`. |
| `virtualizerOptions` | `DataGridTableVirtualizerOptions` | — | Optional passthrough for TanStack Virtual settings like `enabled`, `getItemKey`, `measureElement`, `rangeExtractor`, and `onChange`. |
| `columnVirtualizerOptions` | `{ enabled?: boolean; overscan?: number }` | — | Opt-in horizontal virtualization of the CENTER columns; `overscan` defaults to 3. See the constraints below. |
| `scrollToColumnAlign` | `"auto" \| "center" \| "start" \| "end"` | `"auto"` | Alignment used when revealing `scrollToColumnIndex`. |
| `scrollToColumnIndex` | `number` | — | Index within the center (non-pinned) visible leaf columns to reveal; `scrollBehavior` is shared with row scrolling. |

Column virtualization. With `columnVirtualizerOptions={{ enabled: true }}`, only the center columns
inside the horizontal window render; each off-window flank collapses into one `colSpan` spacer
(`data-slot="data-grid-table-virtual-col-spacer"`) whose width comes from the intact colgroup, so a
fixed table layout cannot drift. It activates only under `tableLayout.width: "fixed"` (the default)
with a single ungrouped header row; grouped headers or `width: "auto"` silently fall back to
full-column rendering. Start- and end-pinned columns stay mounted outside the window, the footer
always renders in full, both virtualizers share the grid's resolved scroll element, and RTL mirrors
automatically. Windowed body cells carry `data-column-index` with their center-column index.
Combining a column window with `cellSelection` is not supported yet: keyboard ranges can span
unmounted columns.

Set `manualPagination: true`. A virtualized grid renders every row, and `dataGridFeatures` registers
`paginatedRowModel`, which is the one row model in the bundle that is not inert: `table.getRowModel()`
is sliced to `pageSize` (default `10`) unless the table opts out. Without it an otherwise correct
virtual grid renders ten rows and stops. `manualPagination: true` is v9's way to say the data already
is the page, so it keeps the pagination APIs while leaving the rows unsliced.

### DataGridCellSelection

The headless spreadsheet controller: keyboard navigation, clipboard, delete-to-clear, and the
fill-handle drag session. Mount it once inside `DataGridContainer`, next to the table, and turn the
feature on with `tableLayout={{ cellSelection: true }}`. It renders a hidden anchor plus the built-in
editor overlay while an edit is open; listeners attach to the grid's own body viewport, while DOM
focus sits on the `<table>` inside it, so a virtualized row unmounting can never strand keyboard
focus.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clipboard` | `boolean` | `true` | Copy, cut and paste: the Cmd/Ctrl+C and X chords plus the native copy, cut and paste events. The chords ride the grid's keydown handler, so they also need `keyboard`. |
| `keyboard` | `boolean` | `true` | Arrows, Home/End, PageUp/PageDown, Enter, F2, type-to-edit, Tab, Ctrl/Cmd+A, Delete, Escape handling. |
| `apiRef` | `RefObject` | — | Receives the controller's imperative API once wired; null while `cellSelection` is off. |

Mouse selection itself (click, Shift-click, Ctrl/Cmd-click for extra regions, and drag) is wired by
the cell renderer whenever `cellSelection` is on; the controller adds everything that needs a
listener beyond the cells.

The imperative API. A create-row flow cannot focus the new row's cell through state alone:
`setFocusedCell` needs the row in the table model, DOM focus needs the grid's focus target, and both
race the commit that mounts the row. `apiRef` hands you `focusCell(rowId, columnId, { edit? })`,
which retries briefly until the row renders, then sets the focused cell, focuses the grid, scrolls
the cell into view and points `aria-activedescendant` at it; `edit: true` also opens the cell's
editor the way Enter would. Call it after appending a row (or saving a draft) and the user can type
immediately. The api also carries `clearSelection()` and `scrollToCell(rowId, columnId)` for
rendered cells.

Accessibility. With `cellSelection` on, the table is an ARIA grid: `role="grid"` with
`aria-multiselectable`, `aria-rowcount` behind pagination, `aria-rowindex`/`aria-colindex` on rows
and cells, `aria-sort` on sortable headers (present with or without `cellSelection`), and
`aria-selected` on every body cell, `true` or `false`. DOM focus stays on the table (the
container-focus model) while `aria-activedescendant` tracks the focused cell, so screen readers
announce every move; keys from a focused in-cell control (a button, link, checkbox, select trigger)
always stay with that control, and Escape hands focus back to the grid. `aria-multiselectable`
reflects `cellSelectionMode`, and the built-in editor is named after its column's header. Keyboard
navigation itself lives in the body cells; header controls are reached with Tab and keep their
native keyboard.

Keyboard map:

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| Arrow keys | Move the focused cell, collapsing the range. |
| Shift + Arrow keys | Extend the range from its anchor. |
| Ctrl/Cmd + Arrow keys | Jump to the grid edge in that direction; with Shift, extend to it. |
| Home / End | First / last cell of the row; with Ctrl/Cmd, the grid's corners; with Shift, extend. |
| PageUp / PageDown | Jump a viewport's worth of rows; with Shift, extend. Jumps clamp to the paginated page; under virtualization they scroll the target row into view. |
| Enter / Shift + Enter | Move down / up; on a writable cell with an editor available, Enter opens it instead, and on a cell whose content is an interactive control (a select trigger, a combobox, a checkbox, a button) Enter activates it. |
| F2 | Open the editor on the focused writable cell, or activate the control it holds. |
| Any printable character | Open the editor seeded with the typed character, replacing the value (the Notion/Airtable flow). Typing never activates a control, only an editor that can hold the character. |
| Space | Toggle a checkbox rendered in the focused cell (the row-select idiom); on a writable cell it counts as a printable character and opens the editor seeded with a space; otherwise swallowed so the page never scrolls. |
| ArrowDown into the appended region | From the last rendered row, focus moves into `appendRow` content or the "Add row" button; ArrowUp from its first row returns to the grid. |
| Double-click | Open the editor on the focused cell, or activate its control: the first click focuses, the second edits, for editor and custom-control cells alike (mouse counterpart of Enter). |
| Tab / Shift + Tab | Move right / left; at the grid edge, focus leaves the grid. |
| Ctrl/Cmd + A | Select every selectable cell. |
| Ctrl/Cmd + C / X / V | Copy and cut write through the async clipboard API (a native copy event never fires for a focused grid), carrying a `text/plain` TSV plus a `text/html` table so Excel and Sheets keep type fidelity, with plain-text fallbacks for non-secure contexts; paste rides the native event. All platforms. |
| Delete / Backspace | Clear writable cells in the selection. |
| Escape | Clear the selection; from a focused in-cell control, return focus to the grid (the ARIA grid exit gesture). |

In RTL, ArrowLeft and ArrowRight mirror to the visual direction; Tab and Shift+Tab do not — Tab
always means the next or previous cell in display order, matching DOM tab order.

The write contract. The grid never mutates data. Every write path (paste, cut, clear, fill, and your
own editors if you route them the same way) produces one batched call to `onCellsChange` on
`DataGrid`, and your state update is the single owner of the rows:

```tsx
interface DataGridCellsChangeDetails<TData> {
  source: "paste" | "cut" | "clear" | "fill" | "edit"
  changes: Array<{
    rowId: string
    columnId: string
    row: TData // the row object, no lookup needed
    previousValue: unknown // enables an undo stack
    value: unknown
  }>
  rejected: Array<{
    rowId: string
    columnId: string
    raw: string
    reason: "readonly" | "invalid"
  }>
}
```

Without `onCellsChange`, copy still works and every write path is a no-op.

Batches act on what the view can show. Selection bounds live in pre-paginated display order, so a
range whose corners are both visible can still span off-page rows in between (a page-tail cell
extended to a bottom-pinned draft row); copy, cut, clear, paste and fill skip rows outside the page
slice plus rendered pinned rows, so the cells a batch touches are exactly the cells the selection
paints. A fill that crosses into a different column round-trips each value through the source's
`format` and the target's `parse` — the paste contract — and reports failures in `rejected`; a
same-column fill keeps raw values.

Per-column editing via `meta.cellEdit`. Presence marks the column writable; every field is optional:

```tsx
meta: {
  cellEdit: {
    editable: true, // false: formats clipboard output but never writes; a function decides per row
    parse: (raw, row) => Number(raw) || undefined, // undefined rejects the cell
    format: (value, row) => String(value), // clipboard output
    clearValue: 0, // Delete/cut value, default null
    control: "text", // built-in editor: "text" | "textarea", optional
  }
}
```

Copy uses `format` on any column, so a select column can emit labels and map them back in `parse`.
Function-form `editable` locks individual rows (archived, another user's, a totals row): every write
path treats a locked row's cell as read-only, the fill preview never tints it, and paste reports it
in `rejected`. A column without `parse` receives the raw pasted string unchanged. A column without
`cellEdit` is read-only: pastes over it land in `rejected` with `"readonly"` instead of changing
data.

Built-in editors. A column with `cellEdit.control` gets the grid's own free-text editor: an overlay
flush over the focused cell, opened by Enter, F2, typing, or double-click, with the cell's own font,
alignment and padding so the text keeps its exact place, and one primary border — the overlay covers
the cell's focus chrome, so opening it reads as the focused box becoming editable. `"text"` is a
single-line input; `"textarea"` grows downward as the text wraps, the Sheets model. Enter commits and
keeps focus on the cell so the result can be reviewed in place (`tableLayout.cellEditEnterAdvance`
restores the Sheets move-down, with Shift+Enter up), Tab commits and moves across, Escape cancels,
blur commits; Shift/Alt+Enter inserts a newline in a textarea, the caret opens at the end of the
value, an unchanged commit dispatches nothing, and rows changing under an open editor cancel it
rather than committing blind. Commits arrive as one `onCellsChange` batch with source `"edit"`,
`parse` applied and rejections reported, so the write path is the same one paste and fill use.

CRUD affordances. All optional and prop-gated. `onRowCreate` renders a quick-create "Add row" as the
body's last row, the Notion/Airtable idiom; what the click creates stays yours. It follows
`tableLayout.dense`, accepts `tableClassNames.rowCreate` for row-height alignment, renders in the
virtual layout too (as does `appendRow`), and when creating unmounts it (a draft row takes its place)
it hands DOM focus to the grid so the keyboard stays live. `getRowStatus` tints rows the consumer
tracks as `"new"` or `"dirty"` and mutes plus strikes `"deleted"` ones; `getCellStatus` draws the
classic corner mark on `"dirty"` (amber) or `"invalid"` (destructive) cells. Omit any of them and
nothing renders — a read-only grid carries zero CRUD chrome.

Consumer editors. Columns without `control` hand the same keystrokes to yours instead;
`onCellEditRequest` on `DataGrid` is how the keyboard asks it to open. It fires only when the column
is writable via `meta.cellEdit`. Without it, Enter, F2 and double-click fall back to activating
whatever interactive content the cell renders, focusing it and clicking it exactly as a mouse would,
so a select, combobox or checkbox in a cell is keyboard-reachable with no wiring at all; a cell
holding plain text keeps the Excel move-down. Typing a character never activates a control:

```tsx
interface DataGridCellEditRequest<TData> {
  rowId: string
  columnId: string
  row: TData
  previousValue: unknown
  initialText?: string // the typed character; absent for Enter and F2
}
```

Seed your input with `initialText` when it is present so typing replaces the value, the way Notion
and Airtable start an edit; commit the result through the same state update as `onCellsChange`
batches, and hand focus back to the grid when the editor closes: focus the
`[data-slot="data-grid-table"]` element inside it, or simply call
`apiRef.current?.focusCell(rowId, columnId)`, which is what the controller itself does.

Exports. Alongside the components, the module exports the pure pieces so a consumer can build custom
flows on the same contracts: `getDataGridVisibleSelectedCellCount(table, viewport)` (the selection
count that matches what is painted), `invertDataGridCellsChange(details)` (the undo batch: values and
previous values swapped, so feeding it through your `onCellsChange` state update implements undo, and
inverting the inverse is redo), `getDataGridActiveRegionGrid`, `buildDataGridClearDetails`,
`buildDataGridPasteDetails`, `parseDataGridClipboardText`, `serializeDataGridClipboardText`,
`tileDataGridClipboardBlock`, and the types `DataGridCellSelectionApi`, `DataGridFocusCellOptions`
and `DataGridPasteTarget` (`DataGridCellSelectionSnapshot`, `DataGridCellSelectionBound` and
`DataGridCopyDetails` come from the `data-grid` module). Every `viewport` argument is the grid's body
scroll viewport, `[data-slot="data-grid-table-viewport"]` inside `DataGridContainer`; passing null
falls back to full-range math that can span off-page rows. For a custom cell renderer, the
`data-grid` module exports `getDataGridCellSelectionCellAttrs(cell)`, the whole td contract
(`aria-selected`, `data-col-id`, `data-cell-selected`, `data-cell-focused` and the four
`data-cell-edge-*` sides), and `dataGridCellSelectionCellClasses`, the chrome those attributes drive;
read both inside a `Subscribe source={table.atoms.cellSelection}` render. `DataGridTableAddRow` is
exported from the table module for custom layouts. The selection overlay's boundary clamps are
driven by the custom properties `--data-grid-overlay-start`, `--data-grid-overlay-end` and
`--data-grid-overlay-bottom` (each defaults to -1px), which `dataGridCellSelectionCellClasses`
consumers can zero out at their own boundaries.

`meta.autoSize`. One column can absorb the container's free space into its committed width, and the
absorbed width reflows LIVE with the container: growing the window widens the column, shrinking hands
the space back down to its `minSize` (or its starting width when none is set), and a streaming window
drag is coalesced into a leading commit plus one settle commit. A width the user dragged is never
touched; a double-click reset on its handle re-arms the fill.

`meta.fillWidth`. Under `columnsResizable`, one column can absorb the free space the filler strip
would otherwise hold, so the grid always reads full-width and the built-in editor covers the whole
cell. While free space remains, manually resizing that column is visually a no-op (the absorbed space
compensates), the usual flex-column trade-off.

Paste semantics follow Excel: a 1x1 block fills the whole selected range; a block tiles when the
range is an exact multiple of it; otherwise it pastes once from the range's top-left, clamped at the
grid edges (rows are never grown). The pasted region becomes the selection (under
`cellSelectionMode: "single"` the focused cell is kept instead). Cut copies the active region, then
clears its writable cells.

Fill handle. With `cellFillHandle` on, dragging the corner handle down or right repeats the source
range over the dragged extent (dominant axis, like Excel), then grows the selection over source plus
filled cells. A same-column fill copies raw values; a fill crossing into a different column
round-trips through the source's `format` and the target's `parse`, rejecting failures into the
batch. Cells that cannot be written are skipped and never tinted by the preview, a multi-region
selection refuses the drag entirely, Escape cancels it, and under virtualization the drag can only
target rendered rows. `tableLayout.cellFillHandleVariant` picks the handle's look,
`tableClassNames.cellFillHandle` restyles it freely, and the handle hides while an editor session is
open.

Interplay with grid features:

- Utility columns (checkboxes, expand toggles, action buttons) opt out with
  `enableCellSelection: false` on the column definition; ranges, keyboard stepping and select-all
  skip them.
- In-cell controls follow the editor's two-step gesture: the first click on an UNFOCUSED cell only
  focuses it (the control does not activate), the second click activates it, so moving the focus
  around can never fire actions. Checkboxes keep their one-click toggle (the row-select idiom),
  modifier presses are selection gestures, drags select as usual, and `cellEditMode: "click"` makes
  everything single-click. Keys inside an editable element never move the selection; Escape hands
  focus back to the grid unless the control consumed it with `preventDefault`. For custom widgets
  built from other elements, put `data-cell-interactive` on the widget's root to opt out entirely, or
  `data-cell-control` on a widget whose active surface is bigger than its buttons (a combobox opened
  by its whole chips strip) to make a press anywhere on it two-step.
- Editing grids should pass `autoResetPageIndex: false` to `useTable`; every commit replaces `data`,
  and the TanStack default would snap a paginated grid back to page 1 on each write.
- With `cellSelection` on, the grid sets `autoResetCellSelection: false` on your table, overriding
  the TanStack default: every write batch replaces `data`, and the default would wipe the selection
  after each commit.
- A page change clears the cell selection. Sorting and filtering keep it: ranges anchor to row ids,
  and rows that leave the view drop out of the selection bounds until they return.
- With `rowsPinnable`, keyboard navigation and every batch walk rendered rows, so pinned rows (a
  bottom-pinned create draft) select, edit and fill like any other row; only the selection bounds are
  stored in data order.
- Undo is intentionally left to the consumer: every change carries `previousValue`, so an undo stack
  is a list of batches replayed through the same state update with `value` and `previousValue`
  swapped.

### DataGridSelectionBar

A thin bulk-edit shell over row selection: selected count, a slot for your controls, and a clear
action. Hidden while nothing is selected, and presented as a floating toolbar the Google Sheets way:
auto width, centered, elevated, sticky to the viewport bottom with breathing room. What the controls
do stays yours; apply bulk updates with your own state update over
`table.getSelectedRowModel().rows`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Your bulk action controls. |
| `label` | `(count: number) => ReactNode` | `N selected` | Custom count label. |
| `clearLabel` | `ReactNode` | `"Clear"` | Label of the clear button. |
| `onClear` | `() => void` | — | Called after the clear button resets row selection. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

### DataGridTableRowPin

A pin/unpin toggle button for use in column definitions to enable row pinning.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `row` | `Row` | — | Required. The TanStack Table row instance. |

`DataGridFeatures` is the type of the exported `dataGridFeatures` bundle. The button pins to the top
region with `row.pin("top")` and clears it with `row.pin(false)`. Turn pinning on with
`enableRowPinning` on the table and `tableLayout={{ rowsPinnable: true }}` on `DataGrid`. In v9 both
`RowPinningState` keys are required, so controlled state has to seed each region:
`useState<RowPinningState>({ top: [], bottom: [] })`.

### DataGridTableRowExpand

A depth-indented expand/collapse toggle for tree data, for use in the tree column's cell. Renders a
chevron button for expandable rows (with `aria-expanded` reflecting state) and a compact spacer for
leaves so leaf content sits close to the parent label.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `row` | `Row` | — | Required. The TanStack Table row instance. |
| `indent` | `number` | `20` | Horizontal offset in px applied per tree depth level. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes for the wrapper. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Custom toggle icon; replaces the default chevron. |

Pass `children` to swap the default chevron for your own state-aware icon, for example
`{row.getIsExpanded() ? <FolderOpenIcon /> : <FolderIcon />}`; the button always carries
`aria-expanded`, so pure-CSS state styling keeps working. The wrapper exposes
`data-slot="data-grid-table-row-expand"` and the computed `--data-grid-tree-padding` CSS variable as
styling hooks. For fully custom cells, the exported `getDataGridTreeIndentStyle(row, indent)` helper
returns the same indent style, and `row.getCanExpand()` / `row.getIsExpanded()` /
`row.getToggleExpandedHandler()` cover bring-your-own toggles.

### DataGridTableFoot

Wrapper component for the table footer (`<tfoot>`).

### DataGridTableFootRow

A row inside the table footer.

### DataGridTableFootRowCell

A cell inside a footer row.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `colSpan` | `number` | — | Column span for the footer cell. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Content of the footer cell. |

## DOM Attributes

Data rows carry these attributes so you can target them from queries, tests, and styles. They are
applied by the shared row renderer, so they appear on standard, virtualized, pinned, and draggable
rows alike, with `data-index` the one exception (only `DataGridTableVirtual` sets it, and only on its
unpinned body rows). Spacer, skeleton, empty, virtual status, and expanded-detail rows are rendered
separately and carry none of them.

| Attribute | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `data-row-id` | `string` | The resolved TanStack Table row id, respecting any `getRowId` configuration. Stable across sorting and pagination. |
| `data-index` | `number` | Index of the row inside the center (non-pinned) section. Set only by `DataGridTableVirtual`, for virtual measurement and stripe parity. |
| `data-state` | `"selected"` | Present while row selection is enabled and the row is selected. Omitted otherwise. |
| `data-row-pinned` | `"top" \| "bottom"` | Which edge the row is pinned to. Omitted entirely when the row is not pinned. |
| `data-row-pinned-boundary` | `"top" \| "bottom"` | Marks the seam between pinned and unpinned rows: the last top-pinned row, or the first bottom-pinned row. |
| `data-depth` | `number` | Depth of the row in a hierarchical row model (`getSubRows` trees or grouped rows). Omitted for root-level rows. |

Header and body cells carry the pinning attributes below. They are the contract the grid's own
sticky-column styling is built on, so they are also the hook to use for your own.

**Renamed in v9**: these values were `left` / `right` before TanStack Table v9. v9 moves column
pinning to logical regions, and the grid follows it, so any CSS selecting `[data-pinned="left"]`
needs updating to `[data-pinned="start"]`.

| Attribute | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `data-pinned` | `"start" \| "end"` | Which edge the column is pinned to. Omitted entirely when the column is not pinned. |
| `data-last-col` | `"start" \| "end"` | Marks the inner boundary of a pinned group — the last start-pinned or first end-pinned column. Carries the divider. |
| `data-outer-pinned-col` | `"start" \| "end"` | Marks the outer edge of a pinned group. Header cells only; used for background clipping. |

Rows carry `data-row-status` (`"new" | "dirty" | "deleted"`, from `getRowStatus`) and cells
`data-cell-status` (`"dirty" | "invalid"`, from `getCellStatus`) whenever those props are wired,
independent of `cellSelection`; they drive the CRUD tints and corner marks. With
`tableLayout.cellSelection` on, body cells additionally carry the spreadsheet contract below (plus
`aria-selected` on every body cell, `true` or `false`, with `role="grid"` and
`aria-multiselectable` on the table). None of these render while the flag is off.

| Attribute | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `data-col-id` | `string` | The TanStack column id, used by the fill session to resolve drop targets. |
| `data-cell-selected` | `"true"` | Present while the cell is inside a positive selection region. |
| `data-cell-focused` | `"true"` | Present on the focused cell. |
| `data-cell-edge-top` | `"true"` | The cell sits on its region's top edge. Same for `-right`, `-bottom`, `-left` (logical in RTL). |
| `data-cell-fill-target` | `"true"` | Toggled imperatively on target cells during a fill drag, for the preview styling. |

The selection chrome is the Sheets model: a light background tint marks membership, a solid primary
perimeter wraps the range and follows it LIVE while a drag or Shift+arrows grow it, the anchor cell
stays unfilled so the typing target reads at a glance, and a lone focused cell draws its box with no
fill at all. While a fill drag is live, one dashed border (the Sheets fill marquee) wraps the whole
pending region — the source plus the extension — and the source's own chrome rests, so the drag reads
as one growing region. Every line except the fill marquee is each cell's own `::before` overlay
driven purely by the data attributes above, so the whole language can be restyled with
`data-[cell-...]` variants on the cell. The fill handle is `data-slot="data-grid-cell-fill-handle"`
on the region's bottom-right cell, the marquee is `data-slot="data-grid-cell-fill-preview"` (one
positioned element appended to the viewport for the session), and the built-in editor overlay is
`data-slot="data-grid-cell-editor"`. The body scroll viewport
(`[data-slot="data-grid-table-viewport"]`) carries one session attribute per gesture:
`data-cell-selecting` while a drag-selection is in progress (the fill handle hides),
`data-cell-filling` for the duration of a fill drag (every selected cell's own chrome rests, so the
marquee is the only painter), and `data-cell-editing` while the built-in editor is open (the edited
cell's chrome and the fill handle hide).

While a column is being resized the grid also renders a full-height vertical line at the pointer,
with a cap in the header. It is only shown in `onEnd` mode — the default — because that is the mode
where the column width does not move until you release, so the line is the only feedback the drag
produces. Target it with `[data-slot="data-grid-table-resize-indicator"]`.

It is positioned imperatively from a layout effect rather than through React state: a resize drag
fires at pointer rate, and routing that through a render would re-render every row on every frame.
The header height is measured once per drag session for the same reason.

Pinned cells stick with the CSS logical properties `inset-inline-start` and `inset-inline-end` rather
than `left` / `right`, so they land on the correct edge in RTL without extra work.

## Base UI vs Radix UI

Detect your build from `components.json` -> `style`: `base-nova` -> Base UI (this file's default),
`radix-nova` -> Radix UI.

Data Grid has no Base UI or Radix UI composed parts of its own (no `render`/`asChild` anywhere in
either mirrored page's diff) — it is a TanStack Table v9 renderer, not a Base UI/Radix UI
composition, so its public API (every table above) is byte-identical between builds. The real
differences are narrower than in Cascader or Filters:

- **Package summary sentence** (not a prop): the Base UI page says "In the base build,
  `data-grid-scroll-area.tsx` is also included and exports `DataGridScrollArea` for dedicated scroll
  handling around sticky-header or wide tables." The Radix page says "The radix build ships the
  shared grid context, footer helpers, virtualization support, row pinning helpers, and the dedicated
  `data-grid-scroll-area.tsx` wrapper used by the latest sticky-header and infinite-scroll demos."
  Despite the differently worded intro, `DataGridScrollArea`'s own API Reference entry (prop table
  and behaviour) is present and identical in both mirrored pages.
- **Usage guide's closing sentence**: "wrap sticky-header tables with `DataGridScrollArea` when you
  want the dedicated **base** scroll wrapper" (Base UI page) vs "...the dedicated **radix** scroll
  wrapper" (Radix UI page) — wording only, same component and API.
- **One demo's toast library differs**: the DOM Attributes section's worked example (see
  [DATA-GRID-EXAMPLE.md](./DATA-GRID-EXAMPLE.md)) imports Base UI's own `Toast` primitive
  (`Toast`, `ToastClose`, `ToastContent`, `ToastDescription`, `ToastPortal`, `ToastProvider`,
  `ToastTitle`, `ToastViewport`, `toast`, `useToastManager` from `@/components/ui/toast`) on the Base
  UI page, and simply `import { toast } from "sonner"` on the Radix UI page — i.e. the Radix build's
  toast demo uses the `sonner` library directly rather than a Radix-flavoured Toast primitive.
- Marketing copy differs ("Base UI primitives from @base-ui/react" vs "the Radix UI implementation
  with accessible primitives from the Radix stack").

Everything else — every `DataGrid*` component's prop table, `tableLayout`, `tableClassNames`,
`DataGridCellSelection`'s full contract (keyboard map, write contract, CRUD affordances, exports),
Internationalization, and DOM Attributes — is identical text between the two builds.
