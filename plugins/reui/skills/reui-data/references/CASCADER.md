# Cascader

Custom Shadcn Cascader for React and Tailwind CSS. A nested multi-level combobox with drill-down
navigation, breadcrumbs, search and custom rows.

Free component — no licence key required.

Cascader is a select whose options form a tree. Instead of scrolling one long list you drill from a
category into its children and commit a value at whatever depth matters. It is the control for
attribute pickers, category trees, org charts, region pickers, permission scopes and file paths.

What it adds over a flat combobox is level navigation: pressing a branch opens it instead of
committing a selection, the popup stays open, and a breadcrumb and a back control say where you are.
The trigger then shows the selection's full path rather than a bare leaf label, because in a nested
picker the leaf alone is frequently ambiguous.

## Installation

```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @reui/cascader
```

(npm/yarn/bun equivalents: `npx shadcn@latest add @reui/cascader`, `yarn dlx shadcn@latest add
@reui/cascader`, `bunx shadcn@latest add @reui/cascader`.)

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  Cascader,
  CascaderContent,
  CascaderEmpty,
  CascaderList,
  CascaderPanel,
  CascaderStatus,
  CascaderTrigger,
} from "@/components/reui/cascader/cascader"
import { CascaderItems } from "@/components/reui/cascader/cascader-item"
import {
  CascaderBreadcrumb,
  CascaderInput,
  CascaderNav,
  CascaderValue,
} from "@/components/reui/cascader/cascader-nav"
import type { CascaderNode } from "@/components/reui/cascader/cascader-types"
```

```tsx
const items: CascaderNode[] = [
  { value: "record-id", label: "Record ID" },
  {
    value: "person",
    label: "Person",
    children: [
      { value: "person.name", label: "Name" },
      { value: "person.email", label: "Email addresses" },
    ],
  },
]

export function AttributePicker() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("person.name")

  return (
    <Cascader items={items} value={value} onValueChange={setValue}>
      <CascaderTrigger render={<Button variant="outline" />}>
        <CascaderValue placeholder="Select an attribute" />
      </CascaderTrigger>

      <CascaderContent className="w-80">
        <CascaderPanel>
          <CascaderNav>
            <CascaderInput />
          </CascaderNav>
          <CascaderBreadcrumb />
          <CascaderEmpty />
          <CascaderList>
            <CascaderItems />
          </CascaderList>
          <CascaderStatus />
        </CascaderPanel>
      </CascaderContent>
    </Cascader>
  )
}
```

That is the minimum worth shipping. Three of those parts are load-bearing beyond their own markup —
`CascaderInput` owns the level keys, `CascaderValue` resolves a selection whose node is not in
`items`, and `CascaderStatus` is the panel's only live region — and Anatomy below has the full shape,
what each part is worth, and the placement rules that are enforced at runtime rather than by the
types.

One thing no part supplies for you is a NAME for the field. The trigger's contents are the field's
VALUE — they change with the selection — so exactly like a native `<select>`, the accessible name
has to come from the author: an `aria-label`, an `aria-labelledby`, or a `<label>` pointed at the
trigger's `id`. Without one a screen reader hears what is picked and never what the field is for, and
the cascader warns about it once in development (`trigger-unnamed`), checking the DOM rather than
props so a `<label for>` pairing counts.

## Anatomy

Cascader is composed rather than configured. Nothing inside the panel is implied: every part you
leave out is simply not drawn, and there is no arrangement the root will silently correct for you.
This is the whole shape, with every part that carries a placement rule in it.

```tsx
<Cascader items={items} value={value} onValueChange={setValue}>
  {/* TRIGGER SURFACE. Exactly one of CascaderTrigger and CascaderChips, and
      it sits OUTSIDE CascaderContent: it is the anchor the popup positions
      against, so it cannot live inside the portal it anchors. Both are
      omitted only with <Cascader inline>. */}
  <CascaderTrigger aria-label="Attribute">
    <CascaderValue placeholder="Select an attribute" />
  </CascaderTrigger>

  {/* PORTAL, POSITIONER AND POPUP, in one part. Dropped by `inline`. */}
  <CascaderContent className="w-80">
    {/* THE PANEL. Also owns the panel's Tab order, which is what keeps the
        footer one press from the field in every mode. */}
    <CascaderPanel>
      <CascaderNav>
        {/* Must render in here, inside the positioner. Owns the level keys,
            so a panel without one has no keyboard path into a branch. */}
        <CascaderInput />
      </CascaderNav>

      {/* Drill mode only. Renders null in columns and in tree. */}
      <CascaderBreadcrumb />

      {/* Empty, loading and error, all three out of one element. */}
      <CascaderEmpty />

      {/* THE ROWS. In mode="columns", CascaderColumns replaces this pair. */}
      <CascaderList>
        <CascaderItems />
      </CascaderList>

      {/* A SIBLING of the list, never a child of it: inside the list it
          would be a row, and would vanish the moment a query matched
          nothing - which is when a command is most useful. */}
      <CascaderFooter>
        <CascaderAction onSelect={createAttribute}>
          Create new attribute
        </CascaderAction>
      </CascaderFooter>

      {/* The panel's only announcement channel. */}
      <CascaderStatus />
    </CascaderPanel>
  </CascaderContent>
</Cascader>
```

### What each part is worth

| Part | Required | Left out |
|---|---|---|
| `Cascader` | Always | Every part that reads state throws by name from the context hook it reads, rather than answering `undefined`. The five that read none — `CascaderNav`, `CascaderSeparator`, `CascaderAction`, `CascaderGroup` and a `CascaderLabel` outside a group — render anyway, as chrome with nothing behind it. |
| `CascaderTrigger` or `CascaderChips` | Unless `inline` | Nothing opens the popup, and `CascaderContent` has no anchor to position against. |
| `CascaderContent` | Unless `inline` | The panel renders in place, unportalled and unpositioned. |
| `CascaderPanel` | Yes | The panel's Tab order is not installed, so the scroll area's own tab stop reappears between the search field and the footer — a variable number of presses, behind an unnamed stop that rings the whole list. |
| `CascaderList` or `CascaderColumns` | Yes | No rows, in any mode. |
| `CascaderItems` | Yes, unless you place rows yourself | The list renders empty. Hand-composed `CascaderItem` runs are the supported alternative — see [CascaderGroup](#cascadergroup). |
| `CascaderInput` | No, but | You lose the level keys. `→`, `←` and `Backspace` are handled on the search field, so the list still arrows up and down and nothing opens a branch or steps back from the keyboard. |
| `CascaderStatus` | No, but | Nothing is announced at all. It is the panel's only live region, and drill-down hides its context in a visual breadcrumb a screen reader user never sees. |
| `CascaderValue` | No, but | The trigger renders whatever you put in it. `CascaderValue` is also what resolves a selection whose node is not in `items`, so a hand-written trigger has to handle that case itself or render blank. |
| `CascaderNav` | No | Layout and the header separator only. `CascaderInput` needs no parent of its own. |
| `CascaderBreadcrumb` | No | Drill navigation says nothing about where you are. |
| `CascaderEmpty` | No | An empty, loading or failed level draws nothing at all. |
| `CascaderFooter` | No | Nothing, quite literally: without children and without a root `actions` array it renders nothing anyway. |

### Placement rules

These are enforced at runtime, not by the types, so a part in the wrong place still compiles. Most of
them fail quietly: the part renders, and something else stops working.

- `CascaderInput` goes inside `CascaderContent`. Base UI only skips refilling the input from the
  committed selection when the input lives inside the popup, and that refill fights every level swap.
  It is also what makes the popup a `role="dialog"`, which is why `labels.panelLabel` exists.
- `CascaderTrigger` and `CascaderChips` go outside `CascaderContent`, as siblings of it. They are the
  anchor and the focusable element outside the popup, so `ref` and `onBlur` belong there too.
- `CascaderChips` REPLACES `CascaderTrigger`. The popup then has to be anchored by hand:
  `useCascaderAnchor()` returns the ref and `CascaderContent` takes it as `anchor`.
- `CascaderFooter` is a SIBLING of `CascaderList`, inside `CascaderPanel`.
- `CascaderItem` belongs inside `CascaderList`, or inside a `CascaderColumns` column. Base UI collects
  its options through the list's own collection, so a row rendered outside one is invisible to the
  arrow keys and to `aria-activedescendant`.
- `CascaderLabel` belongs inside `CascaderGroup`. Outside a group it still draws, and it names
  nothing: a heading loose inside a listbox is dropped from the accessibility tree entirely.
- `CascaderSubmenuTrigger` and `CascaderSubmenuContent` belong inside `CascaderSubmenu`, whose state
  hook throws by name outside one.
- `CascaderColumns` replaces `CascaderList` and renders null outside `mode="columns"`, warning in
  development when it is mounted in the wrong mode. `CascaderBreadcrumb` and `CascaderBack` render
  null outside `mode="drill"` SILENTLY, so a columns or tree panel that mounts one gets an invisible
  part and no hint about why.
- Windowing is opt in at the MARKUP level as well as through `virtualize`. `CascaderVirtualItems`
  goes inside `CascaderList`; `CascaderVirtualColumn` goes through the `CascaderColumns` children
  slot. `virtualize` with neither mounted windows nothing, and says so in the console.

## Examples

The docs page lists 5 named examples with "Copy"/"View Code" affordances but the mirrored page
prints no inline source for any of them (unlike Tree/DateSelector) — only the one-paragraph
description per example below. "The other fourteen" are named but not detailed at all upstream.

### Multi-select

No description printed on the page beyond the heading; a checkbox-rows cascader with `multiple`.

### Columns mode

`mode="columns"` renders the whole open trail side by side, one pane per level (Miller columns), for
when comparing siblings across levels matters more than screen width.

### Tree mode

`mode="tree"` expands branches in place so several groups stay open at once, which is what a
multi-select over a whole tree needs and what drill-down actively works against.

### Async levels

No description printed on the page beyond the heading; demonstrates `getChildren` / paging (see the
`items`/`getChildren`/`CascaderLoadResult` API entries below for the full async contract this example
would exercise).

### Footer actions

No description printed on the page beyond the heading; demonstrates `CascaderFooter` /
`CascaderAction` / `CascaderSubmenu` (see [CascaderFooter](#cascaderfooter) below for the full
contract).

The other fourteen ship exactly as these do and stay browsable on the Cascader components page: deep
search with path-annotated results, custom rows with avatars, color-coded rows and color-coded
categories, trigger path formatting, an embedded panel, flat adjacency data, controlled state,
translated labels, descriptions and disabled options, a form field, hand-composed groups and labels,
consumer-rendered chips, and a windowed level of thousands of rows. The upstream page names these but
prints no code for any of them.

## API Reference

The surface is tiered, and every exported symbol sits in exactly one tier.

- **Public.** Everything from `Cascader` down to the end of Guides: what you compose or call, with a
  full prop table each. This is what the twenty shipped examples are built out of.
- **Extension.** [Advanced](#advanced): exported on purpose so you can go further than the parts do —
  the context hooks, the pure helpers, the lower-level parts a default already renders for you. Named
  with one line of purpose each rather than a prop table. Supported, but not the happy path.
- **Internal.** [Internal exports](#internal-exports): exported only because the registry ships one
  file per module and TypeScript needs cross-file access. Not public API. Listed so you can recognise
  one when your editor offers it, and skip it.

Five parts render a plain element of their own and accept Base UI's `render` prop: `CascaderPanel`,
`CascaderNav`, `CascaderBack`, `CascaderBreadcrumb` and `CascaderValue`. Each becomes the element or
component you hand it while keeping its own classes, data attributes and behaviour.

```tsx
<CascaderPanel render={<Frame />} />
<CascaderBack render={<Button variant="ghost" size="icon" />} />
```

`render` takes a React element or a function returning one. Props are merged rather than replaced,
so the part's own `onClick`, `aria-label` and `data-slot` survive, and anything you pass wins over
the default.

Thirteen more are Base UI parts, so they take the same `render` prop for the same reason:
`CascaderTrigger`, `CascaderContent`, `CascaderInput`, `CascaderList`, `CascaderEmpty`,
`CascaderStatus`, `CascaderItem`, `CascaderChips`, `CascaderChip`, `CascaderGroup`, `CascaderLabel`,
`CascaderSeparator` and `CascaderSubmenuContent`. Two footnotes inside that list. `CascaderLabel` is
a Base UI `GroupLabel` inside a `CascaderGroup` and a plain rendered element outside one, and takes
`render` either way. And `CascaderItem` forwards `render` only on its default `as="option"` path:
`as="button"` renders a plain `<button>` outside Base UI's listbox for the columns trail, where
`aria-setsize`, `aria-posinset` and `aria-level` are explicitly DELETED as illegal on `role="button"`.
`render` is not deleted — it is simply never read on that path, so it reaches the DOM as an
unrecognised attribute and nothing says so: an element lands there as `render="[object Object]"` in
silence, and only the callback form trips React's own `Invalid value for prop` error.

Everything else composes through `children` rather than through its own element, and accepts neither
prop: `CascaderFooter`, `CascaderColumns`, `CascaderColumnPanel`, `CascaderItems`,
`CascaderVirtualItems`, `CascaderVirtualColumn`, `CascaderAction`, `CascaderSubmenu` and
`CascaderSubmenuTrigger`.

### Cascader

`T` is inferred from `items`. `multiple` is the discriminant rather than an ordinary boolean: `value`,
`defaultValue`, `onValueChange` and `max` all narrow off it, so the two mode-dependent shapes are
listed separately below.

Five pieces of state are independently controllable, each with an uncontrolled `default*` twin and a
change callback: `value`, `path`, `expanded`, `open` and `inputValue`. Decide per prop and stay with
it — switching one between controlled and uncontrolled mid-life strands half its state, because the
first update after the switch reads from whichever source is no longer authoritative, and the
cascader warns about it in development.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `items` | `CascaderNode[]` | — | Nested tree, or a flat list when `getParent` is supplied. Rows may arrive in any order, an unknown parent makes a node a root rather than dropping it, and duplicate values are ignored after the first occurrence. |
| `getParent` | `(node) => string \| null \| undefined` | — | Opt in to flat adjacency input, indexed in one linear pass with no client-side re-nesting step, which is what keeps a large normalized dataset cheap to render and cheap to update. `undefined` and `null` both mean "root", so a row typed with an optional `parentId?: string` satisfies it as written. |
| `getChildren` | `(node, ctx) => nodes \| result \| Promise` | — | Fetch one level on demand; `node` is `null` for the root. Return an array, or a `CascaderLoadResult` when the level pages. Only the levels on screen are asked for, a level `items` already fills is never fetched, and fetched pages are kept apart from `items` and merged on top of it, so a new `items` identity never discards what the user drilled into. Mark every branch whose children are not loaded yet `hasChildren: true`, or the row renders as a selectable leaf with nothing to drill into. |
| `onSearch` | `(query, ctx) => nodes \| result \| Promise` | — | Server-side search, replacing the local index scan entirely while a query is set. Hits are resolvable by value but belong to no level, so they never appear in a level list and never come back twice from a deep search. The previous query is aborted the moment a new one is typed. Ignored in `mode="tree"`, where the request is never fired and a development warning says so: a server hit belongs to no visible branch. |
| `searchDebounce` | `number` | `250` | Milliseconds of quiet before `onSearch` fires. |
| `resolveValue` | `(value, ctx) => nodes \| Promise` | — | Ancestor chain for a selection that has not been loaded, root first and the node itself last, so `display="path"` renders the full trail immediately. The chain is placed WITHOUT marking those levels as loaded, so opening one still fetches it for real. Each value is resolved at most once. |
| `loadKey` | `unknown` | — | Cache key for everything fetched. Changing it drops every page, every load state and every resolved node, and aborts anything in flight. Change it when the data source itself changes — a different tenant, a different filter — and reach for `invalidateLevel(value)` on [useCascaderActions](#advanced) when only one branch went stale. |
| `prefetch` | `boolean` | `false` | Fetch a branch's children while it is merely highlighted, after a 150ms pause. Off by default: it trades requests for latency, and the pause is what stops a held `↓` firing a request per row. |
| `onLoadError` | `(error, context) => void` | — | Called when a load fails, alongside the panel's own error state — for logging, a toast, retry telemetry. Carries the level that failed (`context.parent`, `null` for the root) and the `context.reason` that asked for it: the five reasons plus `"search"`, which a level fetch can never report because a search belongs to no level. Typed as a plain `string` for that reason. Never called for an aborted or superseded request: those are navigation, not failures. |
| `mode` | `"drill" \| "columns" \| "tree"` | `"drill"` | Panel layout, row ARIA and arrow keys; the items, the selection and the search model are the same in all three. `"drill"` replaces the list one level at a time, the smallest popup and the only one that stays legible at a phone width. See [CascaderColumns](#cascadercolumns) and [Tree mode keys](#tree-mode-keys). |
| `expandTrigger` | `"click" \| "hover"` | `"click"` | How a branch row in columns mode's active column opens from the pointer. Hover navigates after a short rest and never commits, so a pointer crossing the panel cannot change the value. Drill and tree ignore it, because there a navigation replaces or reflows the rows under the pointer. |
| `multiple` | `false \| true` | `false` | Checkbox rows; the popup stays open while picking. A literal union, not a `boolean`: it is optional `false` on the single arm and a REQUIRED `true` on the multi one, so a `boolean` held in a variable cannot be spread in and the union will not resolve. |
| `selectable` | `CascaderSelectable` | `"leaf"` | Which nodes may be committed: `"leaf"`, `"any"`, or a predicate. The predicate arm is generic over the payload, so an annotated `(node: CascaderNode) => boolean` fits. When a branch is selectable, pressing the row commits it and the chevron becomes its own target for opening it; both the check and the chevron columns are reserved from THIS setting rather than from each row's own answer, so a predicate that accepts one branch and refuses the next does not make the counts and arrows jump down the list. |
| `indicator` | `boolean` | `true` | Draws the built-in single-select check. `false` also gives back the inline-end gutter every style reserves for it, so trailing content ends flush instead of stopping one gutter short. Reach for it when the picker marks selection through something it already draws — a tinted row, a filled leading tile — since `data-selected` stays on the row in every mode. No-op with `multiple`, where the checkbox is the selection CONTROL rather than a decoration, and a development warning says so. `aria-selected` is untouched either way. |
| `actions` | `CascaderActionItem[]` | — | Footer commands, drawn by `CascaderFooter`. See [CascaderFooter](#cascaderfooter). |
| `cascade` | `boolean` | `false` | Propagate a commit over the pressed node's LOADED subtree and reconcile its ancestors. The invariant every rendered state reads off: a branch's value is in the selection exactly when every selectable child of it is, and indeterminate is derived — not selected itself, at least one descendant selected — never stored. What is STORED is the full closure, the branch and every selected node under it, which is what keeps a windowed row's checked state an O(1) set lookup; condense at the edge with `getCascaderCheckedValues` or, for display only, with `CascaderChips`' `strategy`. Needs `multiple` and committable branches, and warns without them. Nodes the `selectable` predicate refuses are skipped on the way down AND ignored on the way up. `max` refuses an over-cap subtree outright rather than keeping an arbitrary prefix of it. |
| `path` | `string[]` | — | Controlled navigation path, deepest last. |
| `defaultPath` | `string[]` | `[]` | Uncontrolled initial path. |
| `onPathChange` | `(path: string[], details) => void` | — | Fires on every level change. `details.reason` is a `CascaderPathChangeReason` — `"drill"`, `"back"`, `"breadcrumb"`, `"reveal"`, or `"external"` for a `setPath` from outside the primitive's own flows — so a controller can tell the user's drill from its own jump without diffing paths. The second argument is optional at the consumer: an existing `(path) => void` keeps compiling. |
| `expanded` | `string[]` | — | Controlled expansion. Tree mode only. |
| `defaultExpanded` | `string[]` | `[]` | Uncontrolled initial expansion. |
| `onExpandedChange` | `(expanded: string[]) => void` | — | Fires when a branch expands or collapses. |
| `open` | `boolean` | — | Controlled open state. |
| `defaultOpen` | `boolean` | `false` | Uncontrolled initial open state. |
| `onOpenChange` | `(open: boolean, details) => void` | — | Fires when the popup opens or closes. `details.reason` forwards Base UI's own reason string (`"escape-key"`, `"outside-press"`, ...); the close a leaf commit performs reports `"item-press"`. |
| `closeOnSelect` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether a single-select leaf commit closes the popup. `false` keeps it open for a compare-and-repick flow; Escape, outside presses and the trigger still close it. Ignored with `multiple`, which already stays open on every commit. |
| `inputValue` | `string` | — | Controlled search query. |
| `defaultInputValue` | `string` | `""` | Uncontrolled initial search query. |
| `onInputValueChange` | `(value: string) => void` | — | Fires as the query changes. |
| `searchScope` | `"level" \| "deep"` | `"level"` | The field filters and never jumps: typing narrows what the current view shows and leaves the selection and the navigation path untouched, so clearing the query puts the user back exactly where they were. `"level"` filters the level on screen, which is the scope a drill-down implies. `"deep"` matches the level you are on AND everything under it — not the whole tree from wherever you happen to be — so a query typed inside Person cannot answer with fields from Workspaces and make the breadcrumb above the results a lie; each hit renders its ancestor trail under its label, and results are capped at 200. In `mode="columns"` only the ACTIVE column is filtered. In `mode="tree"` a query already matches at any depth and auto-expands the ancestors of every hit, so `"deep"` is a no-op there and warns in development. |
| `filter` | `(node, query) => boolean` | label + keywords | Custom matcher. The default is a substring test over the label plus any `keywords` on the node, with both sides folded through `toLocaleLowerCase` so the Turkish dotted and dotless I fold the way that locale expects. A replacement is used in every mode, tree filtering included, and receives an already normalized query so the folding does not repeat per node. |
| `revealSelected` | `boolean` | `true` | On open, navigate to the level holding the selection in the same commit that opens the popup. Turn it off to always reopen at the root — which is also the lever for a deep preselection into a very large level, where the popup's first mount renders that whole level. See [CascaderVirtualItems](#cascadervirtualitems). |
| `maxHeight` | `number \| string` | — | Upper CAP on each level's height, not a fixed height: the panel takes `min(var(--available-height, 100vh), var(--cascader-max-height, 24rem))`, and `--available-height` is the distance from the trigger to the edge of the viewport that the positioner publishes. So a panel opened 200px above the fold is 200px tall and a panel with the whole window under it stops at `24rem`, with nothing to configure. Do not reach for it by default. Three cases genuinely want one: an `inline` panel, which has no positioner and therefore no `--available-height`; a windowed list, where the scrollport height is what the virtualizer divides into rows; and columns mode, where panes side by side have to agree on a height or the popup grows and shrinks as you move between them. |
| `virtualize` | `boolean` | auto | Window the rendered rows. `true` always windows, `false` never does, and left unset the row count decides. Windowing is opt in at the MARKUP level as well: it happens only where a `CascaderVirtualItems` or a `CascaderVirtualColumn` is actually mounted, so a cascader that renders neither never runs a virtualizer whatever this is set to — and `true` with no windowed list mounted is reported to the console in development. The decision is latched per level, so a query that narrows 5,000 rows to 12 does not tear the virtualizer down on the next character. |
| `virtualizeThreshold` | `number` | `100` | Row count at which windowing turns itself on. |
| `estimateRowSize` | `number` | `32` | Row height used before a row has been measured. A starting point, not a contract: every row is measured after it mounts, since rows are two lines tall with a `description`, three in deep search, and each style sets its own row height. |
| `overscan` | `number` | `8` | Rows rendered beyond each edge of the viewport. |
| `labels` | `Partial<CascaderLabels>` | English | Every user-facing string, including announcements. Shallow-merged over the English defaults. See [Labels](#labels). |
| `renderItem` | `(node, state) => ReactNode` | — | Replaces the whole row, affordances included. Reach for it when the row shares nothing with the default. |
| `renderLabel` | `(node, state) => ReactNode` | — | Replaces only the label block, so avatars, badges and status dots drop in while the count, chevron and selected check keep working. Building a leading tile here rather than in the node's `icon` puts it in the LABEL column and leaves the icon slot empty. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | — | Disables the whole control. Unset it reaches Base UI as `undefined`, which reads as false. |
| `name` | `string` | — | Native form field name. See [Forms](#forms). |
| `form` | `string` | — | Id of the form the hidden input belongs to. |
| `id` | `string` | — | Id of the control, for a `<label for>`. |
| `required` | `boolean` | — | Marks the field required for native validation. Omitting it is not the same as passing `false`: omitted, the key is not spread onto Base UI's hidden input at all, so a `Field` wrapper's own value survives. |
| `readOnly` | `boolean` | — | The value can be read and submitted, but not changed. Spread conditionally, on the same terms as `required`. |
| `invalid` | `boolean` | — | Sets `aria-invalid` and `data-invalid` on the trigger, chips and search input. Coerced with `!!`, so unset reads as false. |
| `inputRef` | `Ref` | — | Ref to the hidden input a form library focuses on error. |
| `inline` | `boolean` | — | Render without a floating popup, for in a sidebar, a dialog body or a settings screen. Unset it reaches Base UI as `undefined`, which reads as false. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | The trigger, content and panel parts. |

#### Single select

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `multiple` | `false` | — | Optional on this arm. Omit it, or pass a literal `false`. |
| `value` | `string` | — | Controlled selection. |
| `defaultValue` | `string` | `""` | Uncontrolled initial selection. |
| `onValueChange` | `(value: string, details: CascaderChangeDetails) => void` | — | Fires when the selection changes. The value alone is a bare id, so the second argument carries the resolved node, its path and the whole selection — see [CascaderChangeDetails](#cascaderchangedetails). It does not fire when a change would be a no-op: re-committing the selected value, or a `max` that refuses a pick, stays silent. |
| `max` | `never` | — | Not available: there is nothing to cap. Passing it is a type error. |

#### Multi select

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `multiple` | `true` | — | REQUIRED on this arm, and non-optional. It is what narrows the three below. |
| `value` | `string[]` | — | Controlled selection. |
| `defaultValue` | `string[]` | `[]` | Uncontrolled initial selection. |
| `onValueChange` | `(value: string[], details: CascaderChangeDetails) => void` | — | Fires when the selection changes. See [CascaderChangeDetails](#cascaderchangedetails). |
| `max` | `number` | — | Cap on selections. A pick past the cap is refused rather than the earliest one being dropped, and the refusal is announced through `labels.maxReachedAnnouncement` — a press whose effect is nothing is otherwise invisible to a screen reader user. |

### Parts

The skeleton nearly every cascader writes, listed in composition order.

#### CascaderTrigger

The field itself: a real `<button>` carrying the trailing chevron, and the focusable element outside
the popup, so `ref` and `onBlur` belong here. See [Forms](#forms). A clear control belongs BESIDE it
rather than inside it — a button nested in a button is invalid markup, fails the `nested-interactive`
axe rule, and reopens the popup on the way up from its own click — so position one over the trigger's
inline end, turn `showIcon` off for as long as it stands in for the chevron, and keep the chevron's
width reserved so a long summary truncates before it reaches the button.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `showIcon` | `boolean` | `true` | Render the trailing chevron. Turn it off for a trigger that supplies its own affordance, such as an inline clear button. |
| `ref` | `Ref` | — | The trigger element. Base UI's `Trigger.Props` stops short of `ref`, so the interface adds it back for form libraries. |
| `onBlur` | `FocusEventHandler` | — | The "touched" signal a form library asks for. |

#### CascaderValue

Renders the selection's path in the trigger, with the middle collapsed to an ellipsis. It feeds the
same collapsing helper the in-panel breadcrumb does, so the two can never disagree about how a deep
path reads. It also resolves a selection whose node is not in `items` — async children that have not
been fetched, or an item removed after being chosen — remembering the label of anything that has been
selected and falling back to the raw value, so the trigger never renders blank.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `display` | `"path" \| "leaf" \| "count"` | `"path"` | What the trigger renders. |
| `maxSegments` | `number` | `3` | Visible path segments before collapsing. A limit equal to the path's own depth never collapses anything, so a three-segment path needs `2` to show the difference. |
| `collapse` | `"middle" \| "start" \| "none"` | `"middle"` | Where the path is shortened. |
| `separator` | `ReactNode` | chevron | Separator between segments. |
| `showIcon` | `boolean` | `true` | Render the selected node's icon. |
| `placeholder` | `ReactNode` | — | Shown when nothing is selected. |
| `children` | `(selected, path) => ReactNode` | — | Replaces the whole rendering, the placeholder branch included, so the empty state goes inside it. Passing `placeholder` alongside it leaves a placeholder that can never be reached. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | `span` | Render a different element while keeping the display behaviour. |

#### CascaderContent

Portal, positioner and floating panel in one. Unlike the shadcn `ComboboxContent` wrapper it does not
clamp the popup to the anchor's width — a cascader panel is routinely wider than its trigger, and
columns mode wider again — but it does floor it there, so an ordinary single-column popup still lines
up under the trigger. It takes Base UI `Combobox.Popup` props plus the positioner surface below and
the portal's `container`, forwarded as-is so an unusual anchor situation — a sticky toolbar, a scroll
container that clips, a fixed layout — does not force a rebuild of the whole content stack. There is
deliberately no `trackAnchor` in the list: Base UI 1.5.0's positioner has no such prop.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `side` | `Side` | `"bottom"` | Which side of the anchor to open on. |
| `align` | `Align` | `"start"` | Alignment against the anchor. |
| `sideOffset` | `number` | `6` | Distance from the anchor. |
| `alignOffset` | `number` | `0` | Offset along the alignment axis. |
| `anchor` | `Positioner.Props["anchor"]` | trigger | Position against something other than the trigger. This is how the [CascaderChips](#cascaderchips) flow works. |
| `collisionBoundary` | `Positioner.Props["collisionBoundary"]` | clipping ancestors | What the popup avoids overflowing. |
| `collisionPadding` | `number \| Rect` | `5` | Space kept between the popup and the collision boundary. |
| `sticky` | `boolean` | `false` | Keep the popup pinned to its side while the anchor scrolls out of view. |
| `positionMethod` | `"absolute" \| "fixed"` | `"absolute"` | CSS position strategy of the positioner. |
| `container` | `Portal.Props["container"]` | the body | Where the portal mounts, for a shadow root or a scoped stacking context. |

Give it `w-auto min-w-0` in `mode="columns"`: the `min-w-(--anchor-width)` floor is what stops a
columns panel shrinking to the width its columns actually need, and clearing it lets the panel size
to its content in both directions.

#### CascaderPanel

The nav, list and footer container, with no positioning of its own. Use it inside `CascaderContent`
for the popover case, and on its own with `<Cascader inline>` for an embedded one. It also owns the
panel's tab order — see [Keyboard](#keyboard).

An embedded panel has no positioner, so there is no `--available-height` and the `24rem` cap alone
applies. To make one fill its container instead, the container chain has to give it a height:
`CascaderPanel` is already `flex max-h-full min-h-0 w-full flex-col`, but every flex ancestor between
it and whatever owns the height needs `min-h-0` too. A flex child without it refuses to shrink below
its content, which is the single most common reason a scroll area silently never scrolls.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | `div` | Render a different element while keeping the panel's behaviour. |

#### CascaderNav

Header holding the back control and the search input. The breadcrumb is not part of it: it belongs
to the list below the separator, because it describes where the rows come from rather than what the
field searches.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | `div` | Render a different element while keeping the header's behaviour. |

#### CascaderInput

The search field, and the element that owns the level keys.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `showBack` | `boolean` | `true` | Render `CascaderBack` inline before the field. |
| `placeholder` | `string` | from `labels` | Overrides the per-level placeholder. |

#### CascaderBreadcrumb

The trail of the level on screen AND its ancestors, rendered between the nav separator and the list.
One drill in shows `Company`; two show `Person > Company`. The last crumb is the level you are on: it
is the only segment that is not a button, and it carries `aria-current="page"`. `CascaderValue`
renders the same full path from the trigger, using the same collapsing helper.

Renders nothing at the root, and nothing outside `mode="drill"` — columns draws its own per-pane
headings and tree has no single current level to name. Mount it anyway if the mode is dynamic; it
costs one null.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `maxSegments` | `number` | `3` | Visible segments before the middle collapses. |
| `collapse` | `"middle" \| "start" \| "none"` | `"middle"` | Where the trail is shortened. |
| `interactive` | `boolean` | `true` | Clicking a segment navigates back to that level. |
| `render` | `useRender.RenderProp` | `nav` | Render a different element while keeping the trail behaviour. |

#### CascaderList

The scroll surface for one level. It is bounded by the room the popup actually has —
`min(--available-height, cap)` — and the rows live in a shadcn `ScrollArea`, so the list gets a real,
styled thumb instead of a hidden native scrollbar. The scrollport carries each style's own list
padding as `scroll-padding`, so a row arrowed into view is never left tucked under the panel edge.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `maxHeight` | `number \| string` | root `maxHeight`, then `24rem` | Upper CAP on this level's height, not a fixed height. A short viewport still wins. |
| `style` | `CSSProperties` | — | Applied to the outer shell, which is the element that owns the height. |

#### CascaderItems

Renders one flat run per level, so its indices line up with Base UI's `listRef` and with the
virtualizer's.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `(node, index) => ReactNode` | `CascaderItem` | Replaces the default row component. |

#### CascaderItem

One row. `CascaderItems` renders these for you, so reach for it directly only when you are laying
rows out yourself.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `node` | `CascaderNode` | — | The node this row renders. |
| `index` | `number` | — | Explicit render index. Required in a windowed list, and deliberately IGNORED everywhere else: forwarded outside one it would make the row self-register into `listRef` and take the composite list over, which leaves `aria-activedescendant` pointing at nothing on the first arrow key. Pass it freely — the row decides whether it is safe to use. |
| `depth` | `number` | from the index | Indentation depth. Drives the tree indent. |
| `showPath` | `boolean` | `false` | Render the ancestor chain under the label, for deep-search results. |
| `as` | `"option" \| "button"` | `"option"` | `button` renders identical markup outside Base UI's listbox, for the columns trail. |
| `expanded` | `boolean` | — | Tree mode: this row is an expanded branch. |
| `indent` | `number` | `16` | Pixels of indent per depth, ADDED to the style's own row inset rather than replacing it, which is what makes one level exactly `indent` px wide in all eight styles. Tree mode only. |
| `branch` | `boolean` | from context | Whether the node has children. |
| `selectable` | `boolean` | from context | Whether the node may be committed. |
| `selected` | `boolean` | from context | Whether the node is currently selected. |
| `indeterminate` | `boolean` | from context | Whether the node has some but not all of its loaded subtree selected. `cascade` only. |
| `selectedCount` | `number` | from context | Selected nodes below this one, at any depth. Drives the trailing count. |
| `loading` | `boolean` | `false` | Paging row only: a request for this level is in flight. |
| `error` | `boolean` | `false` | Paging row only: this level's last request failed. |
| `childrenLoading` | `boolean` | `false` | Branch row only: this node's OWN children are in flight. Swaps its chevron (or tree expander) for a spinner in place. `getCascaderMoreProps` resolves it. |
| `childrenError` | `boolean` | `false` | Branch row only: the last attempt to fetch this node's own children failed. Turns the same box into a retry affordance. `getCascaderMoreProps` resolves it. |
| `onClick` | `(event: CascaderRowEvent) => void` | — | Runs BEFORE the row decides what a press means, so it is the place to veto one. |
| `onMouseUp` | `(event: CascaderRowEvent) => void` | — | The same, on the drag-select path Base UI also commits from. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | the row body | Replaces the row's whole body — icon, label, description, count, chevron and check — while the row keeps its role, its ARIA and its press behaviour. The root's `renderItem` still wins over it. This is the hand-composition escape hatch: reach for it on a row you are already placing yourself. |

`CascaderRowEvent` is `React.MouseEvent<HTMLElement>` widened with Base UI's optional
`preventBaseUIHandler()`, which is the only supported way to stop a press committing — calling
`preventDefault()` does not reach Base UI's own handler. The hook is optional because an `as="button"`
row lives outside Base UI's listbox and gets a plain React event, and the element is widened so one
handler serves the option, the button row and the trailing chevron without a cast. The row already
vetoes for you on a branch that cannot be committed; this is for the cases it cannot know about.

`branch`, `selectable`, `selected` and `indeterminate` are optional and fall back to the cascader's
own answers, so a hand-written row is always correct. Pass them when the caller already knows: the
row is memoised, and four booleans let it skip a re-render that a context read would have forced. The
three questions behind them are also answerable directly with `isCascaderBranch`, `isCascaderSelectable`
and `getCascaderCount` from helpers.

Loading a branch happens BEFORE navigation, not after it. Pressing a branch whose children are not
loaded does not move you: you stay on the level you are reading, that row's trailing chevron becomes
a spinner IN PLACE — same box, same width, nothing reflows — and the panel changes level only once
the children have arrived. Drill holds the level swap, columns holds the new column, and tree holds
the EXPANSION, so a failure is a non-event: nothing moved, so nothing has to be undone, and pressing
the row again refires that level. Going back, jumping to a crumb, or closing the popup all abandon the
held navigation. The spinner is `aria-hidden`; the load state is spoken once, by `CascaderStatus`.

In `mode="tree"` the leading expander is its own pointer target, which matters as soon as branches are
selectable: with `selectable="any"` a row press COMMITS, so without a separate expander there would be
no way to open a branch at all with a pointer — and under `cascade` that press would quietly select
the whole subtree of a row that never opened. Row press selects, expander press expands. A leaf
reserves the expander's box even though it has no expander to put in it, so one depth keeps one label
column. With `multiple`, the tree checkbox sits at the HEAD of the row, after the expander, rather
than in the trailing gutter: labels are staggered by depth and a trailing column of boxes is not, so
a grandchild's box would sit directly under its parent's with nothing to say they are different
levels.

#### CascaderEmpty

The empty, loading and error surface, and the one element all three come out of. A level that has
never been fetched says it is loading, one that came back with nothing shows the empty message, and
one that failed shows the error and a real `<button>` retry. It SWAPS ITS CHILDREN rather than
unmounting, because Base UI's `Combobox.Empty` renders whenever the rendered list is empty — which is
as true of a level still fetching as of one that came back with nothing — so anything that mounted and
unmounted around it would announce "No results found." over every async level on its way to loading.
There are no skeleton rows: they promised a shape the level did not necessarily have, and paid for it
with a second layout when the real rows arrived.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `skeletonRows` | `number` | — | Deprecated and ignored. The surface no longer draws skeletons; a loading branch shows a spinner in place of its own chevron instead. Kept in the type so an existing call site still compiles. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | `labels.empty` | Replaces the empty message. Loading and error still win over it. |

#### CascaderStatus

The visually hidden live region. Include one; it is the only announcement channel the panel has.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | the announcement | Replaces the announced text. |
| `render` | `Status.Props["render"]` | `div` | Render a different element while keeping the live region's behaviour. It is a Base UI part, not a `useRender` one. |

### Optional parts

Extra parts you mount only when a specific feature calls for them.

#### CascaderFooter

Commands pinned below the list, where they stay put while the list scrolls, filters down to nothing,
or changes level — which is exactly the moment a command like "Create new attribute" is most useful
and the moment a row inside the list would have disappeared. Render it as a SIBLING of `CascaderList`,
inside `CascaderPanel`; inside the list it would be a row. It renders nothing at all when it has
neither children nor a root `actions` array, rather than reserving an empty strip under every panel.

This is not a fourth navigation mode. Drill, columns and tree stay the only ways to move through the
data tree, and nothing in the footer joins the selection, the filter set or the highlight: a footer
row is a plain `<button>`, never a `Combobox.Item`, because an item would be arrow-reachable, would be
committed by `Enter`, and would vanish the moment a query matched nothing. The arrows still reach it —
`↓` past the last row hands focus down, and either end of the strip hands it back — and keys pressed
in the footer stay in the footer, so `Enter`, `Space`, the VERTICAL arrows, `Home`/`End` and
`PageUp`/`PageDown` are swallowed there. `←` and `→` are not: the horizontal pair is what opens and
closes a footer flyout from its own row. `Escape` and `Tab` are deliberately let through as well.

```tsx
import {
  CascaderAction,
  CascaderFooter,
  CascaderSubmenu,
  CascaderSubmenuContent,
  CascaderSubmenuTrigger,
} from "@/components/reui/cascader/cascader-footer"

;<CascaderPanel>
  <CascaderNav>
    <CascaderInput />
  </CascaderNav>
  <CascaderEmpty />
  <CascaderList>
    <CascaderItems />
  </CascaderList>

  {/* A SIBLING of the list, never a child of it. */}
  <CascaderFooter>
    <CascaderAction icon={<PlusIcon />} onSelect={createAttribute}>
      Create new attribute
    </CascaderAction>

    <CascaderSubmenu>
      <CascaderSubmenuTrigger icon={<ImportIcon />}>
        Import from
      </CascaderSubmenuTrigger>
      <CascaderSubmenuContent>
        <CascaderAction onSelect={importCsv}>CSV file</CascaderAction>
        <CascaderAction onSelect={importCrm}>Salesforce</CascaderAction>
      </CascaderSubmenuContent>
    </CascaderSubmenu>
  </CascaderFooter>
</CascaderPanel>
```

Or, when the actions are data rather than markup, hand them to the root as `actions` and render
`<CascaderFooter />` with no children. Children win over `actions` when both are supplied, so the
data path is a shortcut rather than a different component.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | root `actions` | Composed footer rows. Wins over `actions` when both are supplied. |

#### CascaderAction

One footer command. A real `<button>`, never a `Combobox.Item`. Also usable inside a
`CascaderSubmenuContent`.

`disabled` publishes `aria-disabled` and `data-disabled` rather than the native attribute, and that is
the whole design rather than an oversight. A natively disabled `<button>` is not a tab stop, and the
panel's own Tab order is computed from real tab stops, so a footer whose only row was disabled had no
stop after the search field and was unreachable from the keyboard. ARIA's authoring practices answer
it the other way round: a disabled command stays focusable and announces itself as disabled, so a
keyboard user can discover that it exists. The three things the native attribute did for free are
re-implemented by hand instead — pointer activation is vetoed in the click handler, `Enter` and
`Space` are prevented rather than merely ignored, and the greyed look keys off `aria-disabled` instead
of `:disabled`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `icon` | `ReactNode` | — | Leading icon. |
| `onSelect` | `() => void` | — | Fires on press, after `onClick` and only if that did not `preventDefault`. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Deliberately NOT the native attribute. See above. |

#### CascaderSubmenu

A footer row plus the side-anchored flyout it opens. Controlled or uncontrolled. One level deep on
purpose: a command list that nests is a menu bar in disguise.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `open` | `boolean` | — | Controlled open state. |
| `defaultOpen` | `boolean` | `false` | Uncontrolled initial state. |
| `onOpenChange` | `(open: boolean) => void` | — | Fires on every change. |

#### CascaderSubmenuTrigger

The footer row that opens the flyout, and the element the flyout is anchored to.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `icon` | `ReactNode` | — | Leading icon. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Intercepted here rather than forwarded, exactly as on `CascaderAction`. |

`disabled` cannot be passed through to Base UI's popover trigger: that runs it through `useButton`,
which writes the NATIVE attribute on a `<button>` and takes the row out of the panel's Tab ring —
reproducing on this row the defect `CascaderAction` avoids. So the prop is intercepted, republished as
`aria-disabled` plus a `data-disabled` hook, and the three routes that would still open the flyout are
closed by hand: the opening arrow key, `Enter` and `Space` before they can synthesize a click, and the
click itself through `preventBaseUIHandler()`, since Base UI's `useClick` does not consult
`defaultPrevented`.

#### CascaderSubmenuContent

The flyout. Takes Base UI `Popover.Popup` props plus the positioning four.

A second floating layer inside a combobox popup normally fights the combobox on four fronts at once:
it gets `aria-hidden`, the click that opens it reads as an outside press, the focus that lands in it
reads as a focus-out, and the popup's `overflow-hidden` clips it. This one is a Base UI `Popover`
rendered as a REACT CHILD of the combobox popup, with its own `Portal` and no `container` prop, and
Base UI resolves a nested portal's container to the parent portal node — so the flyout ends up a DOM
SIBLING of the combobox popup, unclipped and not `aria-hidden`, while staying a React DESCENDANT of
it, which is what the combobox's outside-press and focus-out whitelists are computed from. `modal`
stays `false`, so the combobox keeps its own dismissal behaviour, and because `Combobox` builds no
`FloatingTree` the same Escape reaches both layers: the root cancels its own `escape-key` close while
any flyout is registered as open, so the flyout closes first and the cascader second.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `side` | `Side` | `"inline-end"` | Which side of the footer row to open on. |
| `align` | `Align` | `"end"` | Alignment against the row. |
| `sideOffset` | `number` | `8` | Distance from the row. |
| `alignOffset` | `number` | `0` | Offset along the alignment axis. |

#### CascaderChips

The multi-select trigger surface. A multi-select trigger otherwise collapses to
`labels.selectedCount` — "3 selected" — which is right for a narrow trigger and useless the moment
the user wants to drop one of the three without reopening the panel. The chips container REPLACES
`CascaderTrigger`, so the popup has to be positioned against it: `useCascaderAnchor()` returns the
ref for that, and `CascaderContent` takes it as `anchor`. Pressing anywhere in the container that is
not a chip opens the panel.

```tsx
import {
  CascaderChips,
  useCascaderAnchor,
} from "@/components/reui/cascader/cascader"

const anchor = useCascaderAnchor()

<Cascader multiple items={items} value={value} onValueChange={setValue}>
  <CascaderChips ref={anchor} placeholder="Add a column..." />

  <CascaderContent anchor={anchor}>
    <CascaderPanel>...</CascaderPanel>
  </CascaderContent>
</Cascader>
```

Three things it does that a hand-rolled chip list routinely does not: it carries an ancestor path on
a chip only where its label alone would be ambiguous (per selection, so nothing is padded for
consistency's sake), it names every remove button through `labels.removeChip`, and it names the
container through `labels.chipsLabel` — Base UI gives it `role="toolbar"` WHILE the selection is
non-empty, so NVDA keeps focus mode while arrowing between chips, and an unnamed toolbar is announced
as just "toolbar". With nothing selected there are no chips to arrow between, so the role is dropped
and the container is an `aria-label`led plain `<div>` showing the placeholder. Removal goes through
Base UI's `ChipRemove`, which reports the SHORTENED selection to the root, so it lands in the same
`setSelection` every other deselection does and `cascade` applies to a chip press exactly as it does
to a row press. Chips carry the same field, pill and remove-button treatment the shadcn combobox
uses, spelled out per style in the primitive itself, so they match every style without depending on
ReUI's theme CSS.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `placeholder` | `ReactNode` | — | Shown in place of the chips when nothing is selected. |
| `strategy` | `"all" \| "parent" \| "child"` | `"all"` | Condenses a `cascade` closure for display: `"parent"` collapses a fully selected branch to the branch's own chip, `"child"` keeps only the deepest selected frontier, `"all"` keeps one chip per stored value. Display only — the stored value stays the full closure — and removing a condensed chip removes its whole subtree closure and reconciles the ancestors. |
| `children` | `ReactNode \| (nodes) => ReactNode` | one each | Replaces the chip list. Receives the resolved selection, in selection order — keep it that way, because Base UI removes a chip by its position among its siblings. |
| `ref` | `Ref` | — | The popup's anchor. Comes from `useCascaderAnchor()`. |

#### CascaderGroup

A run of related rows. `role="group"`, named by the `CascaderLabel` inside it. Reach for the group
rather than a label on its own: a heading sitting loose inside a listbox names nothing and is dropped
from the accessibility tree entirely, so it looks right and reads as though it were not there.

There is no `group` field on `CascaderNode`, and that is a decision rather than an omission —
`CascaderItems` renders one flat run per level so its indices line up with Base UI's `listRef` and
with the virtualizer's, and grouping inside it would have to renumber both. Compose your own
`CascaderItem` runs when a level needs headings, under three rules about the array you compose them
from:

- The runs are `slice`s of `renderedItems`, in order, each node once. Base UI sizes its `listRef`
  from that array and maps a highlight index straight back into it, so a run built with `filter`, or
  holding a node pulled in from elsewhere in the tree, desyncs the highlight and breaks `Enter`. Apply
  recency by reordering `items`, not by adding rows.
- `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` count across the LEVEL, not the group. Numbering each run from
  one has the second heading announce "1 of 7" over what is genuinely the fourth row of ten.
- No `index` prop outside a windowed list. See `CascaderItem`.

```tsx
<CascaderGroup>
  <CascaderLabel>Recent</CascaderLabel>
  <CascaderItem node={recent} />
</CascaderGroup>

<CascaderSeparator />

<CascaderGroup>
  <CascaderLabel>All properties</CascaderLabel>
  <CascaderItems />
</CascaderGroup>
```

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | A `CascaderLabel` and the rows it names. |
| `render` | `ReactElement \| (props, state) => ReactElement` | default element | Render as another element. |

#### CascaderLabel

A heading. Inside a `CascaderGroup` it becomes that group's accessible name; outside one it is drawn
as a plain element, because the footer flyout is a popover rather than a listbox and a heading there
is read in document order. It carries the same type treatment a combobox heading has in each style —
uppercase and tracked in `sera`, not in the other seven — and overrides only its inset, so a heading
lines up with the rows under it.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | The heading text. |
| `render` | `ReactElement \| (props, state) => ReactElement` | default element | Render as another element. |

#### CascaderSeparator

A rule between two runs. Decorative: it renders `role="presentation"` and `aria-hidden`, because a
`listbox` may not own a `role="separator"` and a run that needs separating for a screen reader needs
a `CascaderGroup`, not a line. Pass `role="separator"` yourself to take the role back where one is
legal. It takes its negative margin from `--cascader-list-pad`, so the rule reaches the panel edge in
the list, in the footer, and in `lyra`, whose list has no padding at all.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orientation` | `"horizontal" \| "vertical"` | `"horizontal"` | Base UI's separator orientation. |
| `render` | `ReactElement \| (props, state) => ReactElement` | default element | Render as another element. |

#### CascaderColumns

Renders the trail in `mode="columns"`. Replaces `CascaderList`. Only the deepest column is the
listbox, because Base UI owns one list: `↑` and `↓` move within the active column, `→` opens the
highlighted branch into a new column, and `←` steps back one. The trail behind renders as plain
buttons and is pointer-first — pressing a trail row jumps straight back to that branch. Each column
gets its own scroll area, which matters more here than anywhere else: three side-by-side panes with
no scrollbars give no hint that any of them has more rows below the fold.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `columnWidth` | `number \| string` | `220` | Width of each column. |
| `maxHeight` | `number \| string` | root `maxHeight`, then `24rem` | Upper CAP on each column's height, not a fixed height. |
| `children` | `(column) => ReactNode` | default panel | Receives a `CascaderColumn` and replaces the panel for every column. This is the slot `CascaderColumnPanel` goes through. |

#### CascaderVirtualItems

Windowed replacement for `CascaderItems` in drill and tree modes: under `virtualizeThreshold` rows it
renders exactly what `CascaderItems` renders, and above it, it windows. Nothing else about the
cascader changes — the same keyboard model, the same search, the same row component. It lives in its
own file, which `@reui/cascader` installs along with `@tanstack/react-virtual`.

```tsx
import { CascaderVirtualItems } from "@/components/reui/cascader/cascader-virtual"

<CascaderList maxHeight={288}>
  <CascaderVirtualItems />
</CascaderList>
```

Two rules are not stylistic preferences: windowing a Base UI combobox only works if they are
followed. Pass elements to the list, never a function child, because `Combobox.List` implicitly
wraps a function child in a `Collection` and a Collection renders every filtered item. And do not
hand `CascaderItem` an index of your own outside a windowed list — see the `index` prop on
`CascaderItem`. The highlighted row stays mounted even when scrolled far out of the window, so
`aria-activedescendant` always points at a real element, and the panel scrolls the highlight into
view itself, since Base UI's own scroll-into-view cannot see a row that is not rendered.

Windowing fixes the level; it does not fix MOUNTING the popup onto one, and that second cost is the
one that gets mistaken for the first. With `revealSelected` on, a cascader that boots with a deep
value opens straight onto that level, so the popup's very first mount is a full render of it — Base
UI's per-item work at mount, which windowing cannot remove — and `CascaderContent` unmounts on close,
so every REOPEN pays it again. Size the level, not just the total.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `estimateSize` | `number` | root `estimateRowSize` | Row height used before a row has been measured. |
| `overscan` | `number` | root `overscan` | Rows rendered beyond each edge of the viewport. |

### Types

The item payload is inferred from `items`, so `node.data` arrives typed in every callback without a
type argument anywhere:

```tsx
interface Member {
  initials: string
  role: string
}

const teams: CascaderNode<Member>[] = [...]

<Cascader
  items={teams}
  // `node.data` is `Member | undefined`, not `any`.
  renderLabel={(node) => <Avatar>{node.data?.initials}</Avatar>}
/>
```

`multiple` discriminates the props, so the value and the callback narrow together. Single-select
hands back a `string`, multi-select a `string[]`, and `max` only exists on the multi-select side:

```tsx
// Single: `next` is a string.
<Cascader items={items} onValueChange={(next) => setValue(next)} />

// Multiple: `next` is a string array, and `max` is available.
<Cascader multiple max={5} items={items} onValueChange={(next) => setValues(next)} />

// Type error: `max` caps a multi-selection, and single mode has nothing to cap.
<Cascader items={items} max={5} />
```

`useCascaderSelection` takes no arguments, so pass the payload explicitly when you need it:
`useCascaderSelection<Member>()`.

Everything else a consumer ever names is one of these:

- Supplied by you: `CascaderNode`, `CascaderActionItem`, `CascaderLabels`, `CascaderLoadResult`.
- Received in a callback you write: `CascaderChangeDetails`, `CascaderItemState`,
  `CascaderLoadContext`, `CascaderSearchContext`, `CascaderLoadState`, and `CascaderRowEvent` on a
  row handler — see `CascaderItem`.
- Naming the root, its props or its selection: `CascaderProps`, `CascaderBaseProps`,
  `CascaderSingleProps`, `CascaderMultipleProps`, and `CascaderSelection`, which is what
  `useCascaderSelection()` returns. `CascaderGetChildren`, `CascaderOnSearch` and
  `CascaderResolveValue` type a loader declared outside JSX.
- String unions, spelled inline wherever the prop they type is documented: `CascaderMode`,
  `CascaderSearchScope`, `CascaderCollapse`, `CascaderValueDisplay`, `CascaderChangeReason`,
  `CascaderPathChangeReason`, `CascaderCheckedStrategy` and `CascaderLoadReason`. None of them needs
  a section of its own. `CascaderSelectable<T>` is the near-exception: its predicate arm is generic
  over the item payload, so an annotated `(node: CascaderNode<Member>) => boolean` satisfies
  `CascaderSelectable<Member>` — a per-call generic would refuse it — and the `unknown` default keeps
  a bare `CascaderSelectable` meaning what it always meant.

Every part's `*Props` type is exactly as public as the part itself, and is named `<PartName>Props`
without exception. The types published on the context hooks — `CascaderIndex`, `CascaderFlatNode`,
`CascaderColumn`, `CascaderHighlight` and the three context shapes — are extension surface and live
under [Advanced](#advanced).

They come from three modules. The data and i18n types are in `cascader-types`, the context ones in
`cascader-context` (re-exported by `cascader` as well), and the three loader signatures in
`cascader-async`.

#### CascaderNode

Items are supplied either nested, each node carrying `children`, or as a flat adjacency list where
each row carries a parent pointer and you pass `getParent`. Both normalize to the same internal
index.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `value` | `string` | — | Stable unique id. Also the committed selection value. |
| `label` | `string` | — | Display text. Used for filtering and typeahead. |
| `icon` | `ReactNode` | — | Leading icon rendered by the default row. Best left without a size class of its own: every style sizes a bare glyph itself through a `[&_svg:not([class*=size-])]` rule, so a hardcoded size pins one icon while the chevron beside it keeps following the style. |
| `description` | `string` | — | Secondary line under the label. |
| `children` | `CascaderNode[]` | — | Nested children. Omit when using `getParent`. |
| `hasChildren` | `boolean` | `false` | Marks a branch before its children are known. Required for async nodes. |
| `hasMore` | `boolean` | `false` | Another page of children exists. Only read on a node nested inside a `getChildren` result. |
| `count` | `number` | children length | Trailing count on a branch row. A selected branch keeps it: how many things are inside a category and whether it is picked are different facts. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Not selectable; stays rendered and `aria-disabled` rather than being dropped, so the reason an option is unavailable stays discoverable. Refused BEFORE `selectable` is consulted, and the refusal inherits down the subtree — a disabled branch cannot be opened, and a deep-search hit under one cannot be committed either. |
| `keywords` | `string[]` | — | Extra terms matched by search alongside the label. |
| `data` | `T` | — | Arbitrary payload, passed through to render callbacks. |

#### CascaderItemState

The second argument of `renderItem` and `renderLabel`: everything the default row had already worked
out, so a custom row does not derive it a second time.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `branch` | `boolean` | The node has children, known or declared with `hasChildren`. |
| `selected` | `boolean` | The node is currently selected. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | The node's own `disabled` flag, not the answer to "may this be committed". |
| `depth` | `number` | Zero-based depth of the row. |
| `count` | `number` | Trailing count. An explicit `count` wins over the number of loaded children. |
| `path` | `CascaderNode[]` | Ancestors of the node, root first and the node itself EXCLUDED. Empty unless the row is a deep-search result. |

#### CascaderChangeDetails

The second argument of `onValueChange`, so the usual follow-up questions need no lookup at the call
site.

```tsx
<Cascader
  items={items}
  onValueChange={(value, details) => {
    setValue(value)
    // "Person / Company / Domain", with no lookup into `items`.
    setLabel(details.path.map((node) => node.label).join(" / "))
  }}
/>
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `node` | `CascaderNode \| null` | The node that was committed or toggled. Null when the selection was cleared. |
| `path` | `CascaderNode[]` | Ancestor chain of `node`, root first, node last. |
| `nodes` | `CascaderNode[]` | Every currently selected node, resolved. |
| `reason` | `"select" \| "deselect" \| "clear"` | Why the callback fired. |

`nodes` is resolved the same way the trigger resolves its label, so a selection whose node is not in
`items` still comes back rather than being silently dropped. `reason` is `"clear"` only when the
whole selection is dropped in one go, which is what `useCascaderSelection().clear()` does;
deselecting the last remaining node reports `"deselect"` with that node, so the information is never
lost.

#### CascaderActionItem

The shape of one entry in the root's `actions` array.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `label` | `ReactNode` | Row content. |
| `value` | `string` | Stable key. Falls back to a string label, then the index. |
| `icon` | `ReactNode` | Leading icon. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `aria-disabled`, never the native attribute. See [CascaderAction](#cascaderaction). |
| `onSelect` | `() => void` | Fires on press. Ignored when `items` is present. |
| `items` | `CascaderActionItem[]` | Turns the row into a submenu trigger. One level deep. |
| `group` | `string` | Heading rendered above this entry inside a flyout. One heading per RUN of entries sharing it. |

#### CascaderLoadResult

What `getChildren` and `onSearch` may return instead of a bare array. Return a `nextCursor` and the
level grows a "Load more" row after its last loaded child; pressing it calls `getChildren` again with
that cursor and appends the result. That row is a REAL option in the rendered list, not an invisible
scroll sentinel, because every index Base UI hands out is an index into the same array — and being a
node also makes it keyboard reachable, which an `IntersectionObserver` sentinel never is. It is never
selectable, whatever `selectable` is set to. Paging is latched per level: a page that comes back with
nothing new while the server still reports `hasMore: true` cannot be asked for again, or one click
becomes an unbounded request loop.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `items` | `CascaderNode[]` | The level's nodes. Nested `children` are walked too. |
| `nextCursor` | `string` | Handed back to `getChildren` for the next page. |
| `hasMore` | `boolean` | Whether a further page exists. Defaults to whether `nextCursor` was supplied. |

#### CascaderLoadContext

The second argument handed to `getChildren`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `signal` | `AbortSignal` | Aborted when the request is superseded, the popup closes, or `loadKey` changes. |
| `cursor` | `string` | The previous page's cursor, or `undefined` for the first page. |
| `reason?` | `"level" \| "more" \| "prefetch" \| "retry" \| "resolve"` | Why the level is being fetched. OPTIONAL, and additive: a loader written before the field existed still type-checks and still behaves the same. |

A level load is NOT aborted merely because the user navigated elsewhere: the page is still worth
caching. Responses are additionally guarded by a per-level request id, so a slow response that lands
after a newer one is discarded rather than overwriting it. A loader that throws SYNCHRONOUSLY lands
in the same error state rather than taking the render down with it.

#### CascaderSearchContext

The second argument handed to `onSearch`. Not the same shape as `CascaderLoadContext`: a search
belongs to no level, so it carries no cursor and no reason, and it carries the current path instead.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `signal` | `AbortSignal` | Aborted when the query changes or the popup closes. |
| `path` | `string[]` | The path the user is searching within, deepest last. Node VALUES, not nodes. |

`path` is what scopes a server query to the level the user is actually looking at:
`path[path.length - 1]` is the current parent, and an empty array means the root.

#### CascaderLoadState

One level's async state. Read it through `useCascaderLoadState()` rather than reaching into
`loadStates` by hand.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `loading` | `boolean` | A request for this level is in flight. |
| `error` | `boolean` | The last request for this level failed. Cleared by a retry. |
| `hasMore` | `boolean` | More pages are available for this node. |
| `cursor` | `string` | Opaque cursor handed back to `getChildren` for the next page. |

There is deliberately no `status` field. MAP MEMBERSHIP is the discriminator between "declared a
branch but never fetched" and "fetched and genuinely empty": a level with no entry has never been
loaded, and one with an entry, no `loading`, no `error` and no children came back empty for real. A
status field would be a second source of the same truth and the two would eventually disagree.

### Hooks

The three hooks a composed surface reaches for. The context hooks the panel's own parts read —
`useCascaderState()`, `useCascaderActions()` and the rest — are extension surface and live under
[Advanced](#advanced).

#### useCascaderSelection

The headless trigger. `CascaderValue` covers the common shapes and `CascaderChips` covers chips; when
the trigger needs to be something else entirely — a two-line label, a table cell, an avatar stack, or
chips that sit beside a trigger that stays a trigger — this hook returns the resolved nodes and their
ancestor chains as plain data, plus the mutators a custom surface needs.

```tsx
function ResourceValue() {
  const { firstPath, isEmpty } = useCascaderSelection()
  if (isEmpty) return <span>Select a resource</span>

  const brand = firstPath[0]
  const leaf = firstPath[firstPath.length - 1]

  return (
    <span>
      {brand?.icon}
      {leaf?.label} <code>{leaf?.value.split(".").join("/")}</code>
    </span>
  )
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `selected` | `CascaderNode[]` | The selected nodes, resolved. |
| `paths` | `CascaderNode[][]` | Ancestor chain per selection, root first. |
| `first` | `CascaderNode \| null` | The single selection, or the first one. |
| `firstPath` | `CascaderNode[]` | Ancestor chain of `first`. |
| `count` | `number` | Number of selections. |
| `isEmpty` | `boolean` | Whether nothing is selected. |
| `multiple` | `boolean` | Whether the cascader is in multi-select mode. |
| `remove` | `(value: string) => void` | Deselects one node. |
| `clear` | `() => void` | Deselects everything. |

Drive a hand-rolled chip list off `paths` rather than `selected`: a path carries the ancestors and
its own leaf, and `selected` drops values the index cannot resolve, so the two arrays are not
guaranteed to line up index for index. The three things `CascaderChips` does for free — a
disambiguating path, a named remove button, a named container — are yours to supply here, and
`findAmbiguousCascaderLabels` in helpers is the rule behind the first of them. Note also that
`remove()` and `setSelection()` replace the selection exactly as given, with NO cascade propagation:
they are the deliberate escape hatch for a caller that has already decided what the selection should
be.

#### useCascaderSubmenu

Inside a `CascaderSubmenu`, returns the flyout's own state. Throws outside one.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | `boolean` | Whether the flyout is open. |
| `setOpen` | `(open: boolean) => void` | Opens or closes it. |
| `close` | `() => void` | The one a custom flyout entry usually wants: a command closes its own list behind it. |
| `rowRef` | `RefObject` | The footer row the flyout is anchored to. |
| `triggerId` | `string` | Id of that row. A menu is labelled by the control that opens it. |
| `keyboardRef` | `RefObject` | Whether the pending open came from the KEYBOARD, which is what decides between focusing the first entry and focusing the popup. Written by the trigger, read during the focus phase. |

The interface itself is not exported, so name the return with `ReturnType<typeof useCascaderSubmenu>`
if you need to pass it around.

#### useCascaderAnchor

Returns the ref for the chips container, to be handed to `CascaderContent`'s `anchor`. It is a
`useRef` and nothing more — it exists so the wiring has a name rather than being an undocumented
convention.

### Guides

Cross-cutting concerns that touch every part: form submission, writing direction and copy.

#### Forms

The cascader submits through a hidden input Base UI owns, so it behaves like a native field rather
than needing a controller wrapper around it.

```tsx
<Cascader
  items={items}
  name="attribute"
  id="attribute-field"
  form="settings"
  required
  invalid={!!errors.attribute}
  inputRef={register("attribute").ref}
/>
```

| Prop | What it reaches |
|---|---|
| `name` | The hidden input's `name`. The submitted value is the selected node's `value`. |
| `form` | The hidden input's `form`, for a cascader rendered outside the `<form>` it submits to. |
| `id` | The control's id, so a `<label for>` points at something real. |
| `required` | The hidden input's `required`, for native validation. |
| `readOnly` | Refuses every commit. The value is still readable and still submits. |
| `disabled` | Disables the whole control. |
| `invalid` | `aria-invalid` and `data-invalid` on the trigger, the chips container and the search input. |
| `inputRef` | A ref to the hidden input — the element a form library focuses when it reports an error on this field. |

`invalid` is a boolean and carries no message: the message belongs next to the field, in whatever
`Field` or `FormMessage` the form library already renders. The chips container keys its error
treatment off `aria-invalid` on a descendant, so setting `invalid` is all there is to wire.

`onBlur` and `ref` go on `CascaderTrigger`, which is the focusable element outside the popup and
therefore the one a "touched" signal should come from. With react-hook-form specifically,
`Controller` wires all of it in one place — the value through `field`, the error state through
`fieldState`:

```tsx
<Controller
  name="attribute"
  control={control}
  defaultValue=""
  rules={{ required: "Pick an attribute" }}
  render={({ field, fieldState }) => (
    <Cascader
      items={items}
      value={field.value}
      onValueChange={field.onChange}
      invalid={fieldState.invalid}
      inputRef={field.ref}
    >
      <CascaderTrigger onBlur={field.onBlur}>
        <CascaderValue placeholder="Select an attribute" />
      </CascaderTrigger>
      <CascaderContent>...</CascaderContent>
    </Cascader>
  )}
/>
```

`defaultValue=""` keeps `value` controlled from the first render instead of switching mid-life, which
the cascader warns about.

#### Right to left

The panel mirrors under `dir="rtl"`, including the parts that are not visual:

- The level keys swap. "Deeper" is the direction the text runs, so in RTL `←` opens a branch and `→`
  goes back. Tree mode's expand and collapse keys swap with them. The caret-edge guards do not swap:
  `selectionStart === 0` is the logical start of the value in both directions. `labels.keyboardHint`
  receives the resolved direction alongside the mode, so the default hint names the mirrored keys
  rather than teaching exactly the wrong ones.
- The check gutter and the check follow the inline direction. Both are pinned with physical
  properties in the shared combobox style sheets — a flat `pr-8` and a `right-2` that match neither
  each other nor the style's own start padding. The cascader restates them on its own rows as
  `padding-inline-*` and `inset-inline-end` against one variable, `--cascader-row-inset`, so there is
  no second rule for RTL to keep in step and a row's two insets are equal in both directions. Set that
  variable on a row, or on anything above it, to change both at once without `!important`.
- The tree expander stops mirroring once it is expanded, because a chevron pointing down points the
  same way in both writing modes.

The direction is resolved from Base UI's `DirectionProvider` first, then from the nearest `dir`
attribute, then from the computed style. `<html dir="rtl">` is enough on its own. Mount a
`DirectionProvider` when `dir` is scoped to a subtree of the page instead: the popup is portalled to
the body, so a subtree attribute never reaches it — and Base UI's own RTL behaviour reads the same
provider.

#### Labels

`labels` is the entire i18n story: every user-facing string the cascader can render comes from it,
`aria-label`s and live-region announcements included, so a translated build needs no wrapper
component. It is shallow-merged over the English defaults, so pass one key without restating the
rest.

Callbacks take plain strings rather than nodes on purpose. A `CascaderNode<T>` parameter would force
the labels object to carry the item generic, and a concrete `CascaderNode<string>` would then fail to
satisfy it.

Visible copy:

| Key | Type | Default | Rendered |
|---|---|---|---|
| `search` | `string \| (parentLabel?) => string` | `Search {level}...`, or `Search...` | Placeholder of the search input. The parameter is optional and is absent at the root level, where the default falls back to a bare `Search...` with no level name in it. |
| `back` | `string` | `Back` | Accessible name of `CascaderBack`. |
| `empty` | `string` | `No results found.` | A level that came back with nothing. |
| `loading` | `string` | `Loading...` | A level's first page is in flight. |
| `loadingMore` | `string` | `Loading more...` | The next page of a level that already has rows is in flight. |
| `loadMore` | `string` | `Load more` | The idle paging affordance. |
| `error` | `string` | `Could not load items.` | A level failed to load. |
| `retry` | `string` | `Retry` | The retry affordance next to `error`. |
| `selectedCount` | `(count) => string` | `{n} selected` | `CascaderValue` with `display="count"`, and any multi-selection of more than one. |
| `removeChip` | `(label) => string` | `Remove {label}` | Accessible name of a chip's remove button. |
| `pathSeparator` | `string` | `/` | Between ancestors in a deep-search row's trail, in a path-disambiguated chip, and in the collapsed-path tooltips. |

Names for things the visible markup cannot say:

| Key | Type | Default | Names |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rootLevel` | `string` | `Top level` | The root list and the root column, which have no parent node to name them. |
| `panelLabel` | `string` | `Options` | The popup. Base UI gives it `role="dialog"` once the input lives inside it, and an unnamed dialog is announced as just "dialog". |
| `columnsLabel` | `string` | `Levels` | The `CascaderColumns` container, so its panels read as levels of one thing. |
| `actionsLabel` | `string` | `Actions` | The `CascaderFooter` group, so its buttons do not read as more options. |
| `submenuAffordance` | `string` | `opens a menu` | Appended to a `CascaderSubmenuTrigger`, so a footer row that opens a flyout is not announced identically to one that fires. |
| `breadcrumbLabel` | `string` | `Breadcrumb` | The in-panel trail. |
| `chipsLabel` | `string` | `Selected items` | The chips container. The name is kept whether or not Base UI is giving it `role="toolbar"`. |
| `itemCount` | `(count) => string` | `{n} item` / `{n} items` | Appended to a branch row's name, so "Person 24" reads as "Person, 24 items". The English default already pluralises at one. |
| `branchAffordance` | `string` | `submenu` | Appended to a branch row outside tree mode, where the row opens another list. |
| `selectedState` | `string` | `selected` | Appended to a selected columns-trail row. Those are plain buttons, so they carry no `aria-selected`. |
| `partiallySelectedState` | `string` | `partially selected` | The `cascade` counterpart, for a trail row with some but not all of its subtree selected. Option rows say this with `aria-checked="mixed"` instead. |
| `keyboardHint` | `(mode, dir: "ltr" \| "rtl") => string` | per mode and direction | The visually hidden description of the arrow-key model, read out by the search input. Per mode AND per writing direction: the level keys mirror in RTL, so a hint naming the LTR keys there would teach exactly the wrong ones. |

Live-region announcements, read by `CascaderStatus`, which is the panel's only announcement channel:

| Key | Type | Default | Announced |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rootAnnouncement` | `(count) => string` | `Top level, {itemCount}` | Navigation returns to the root level. |
| `levelAnnouncement` | `(parentLabel, depth, count) => string` | `{parent}, level {d}, {itemCount}` | A level change. |
| `expandedAnnouncement` | `(label, count) => string` | `{label} expanded, {itemCount}` | A tree branch expands. |
| `collapsedAnnouncement` | `(label) => string` | `{label} collapsed` | A tree branch collapses. |
| `resultsAnnouncement` | `(count) => string` | `1 result` / `{n} results` | The result count after filtering. |
| `maxReachedAnnouncement` | `(max) => string` | `Selection limit of {max} reached` | `max` refuses a further pick. |
| `cascadeAnnouncement` | `(label, count, selecting) => string` | `{label} selected` / `{label} deselected`, then `, {itemCount} followed` | A `cascade` commit sweeps a subtree. `selecting` is what picks the arm. |
| `searchingAnnouncement` | `string` | `Searching...` | An `onSearch` request is in flight. |

Four of those defaults compose an item count rather than interpolating a bare number, which is why
the English copy reads "1 item" and not "1 items": `rootAnnouncement`, `levelAnnouncement`,
`expandedAnnouncement` and `cascadeAnnouncement`. `resultsAnnouncement` pluralises the same way on
its own. `levelAnnouncement`'s `depth` is one-based and matches the `aria-level` tree mode gives the
same rows, so the spoken numbering and the ARIA numbering can never disagree by one.

Overriding `itemCount` does NOT reach those four. `labels` is a shallow merge, and each of the four
English defaults closes over the module-local count helper rather than reading `labels.itemCount`
back out, so a replacement changes only what the four do not draw: the branch row's own name.
`rootAnnouncement` has the same relationship with `rootLevel`. Translate the announcements
themselves, not the pieces they look like they are built from — which is also cheaper, since each one
is a single template string.

Casing is never applied for display: a label is already written the way its author wants it read, and
`toLowerCase()` is locale-hostile — it maps Turkish "İ" to a two-code-point sequence. Matching is a
different matter and folds BOTH the query and the label through `toLocaleLowerCase()`, so the two
sides always fold the same way whatever the host locale is.

#### Development warnings

Several ways of misconfiguring a cascader are absorbed SILENTLY at runtime, because degrading is the
right behaviour for a rendering primitive: a duplicate value is dropped, a `getParent` cycle is
clamped, a prop belonging to another mode is ignored. Each of those is also an afternoon someone will
not get back, so in development the cascader says so. Each one is a `console.warn` behind a shared
once-per-key ledger, never fires in production, and never throws. Keys that name an offending value —
a duplicate, a cycle — warn once per value; the rest warn once per page.

| Warned about | Why it is silent otherwise |
|---|---|
| A duplicate node `value` | The first occurrence wins and the rest never render. |
| A `null` or `undefined` entry in `items` or in a node's `children` | The entry is skipped, so a sparse array or a failed `map` silently loses a row. |
| A cycle in flat `getParent` input | The depth walk is cycle-guarded, so every depth on that chain is clamped rather than derived. |
| `value`, `path`, `expanded`, `open` or `inputValue` switching between controlled and uncontrolled | The first update after the switch reads from whichever source is no longer authoritative. |
| `multiple` with a string `value`, or an array `value` without `multiple` | A shape mismatch resolves to no selection at all. |
| `cascade` without `multiple`, or with `selectable="leaf"` | Nothing can ever cascade. |
| `max` without `multiple` | There is only one selection to cap. |
| `indicator={false}` with `multiple` | The checkbox is the selection control, so it and its gutter stay either way. |
| `expanded` outside `mode="tree"`, `path` inside it | The other mode navigates with the other prop. |
| `searchScope="deep"` in `mode="tree"` | A tree query already matches at any depth. |
| `CascaderColumns` outside `mode="columns"` | It renders nothing, so every prop on it does nothing. |
| `CascaderChips` without `multiple` | There is only ever one chip. |
| `onSearch` in `mode="tree"` | A server hit belongs to no visible branch, so its results could never render. The request is not fired. |
| A `CascaderTrigger` with no accessible name | The trigger's contents are the field's value, so what is picked is announced and what the field is for never is. |
| `virtualize` with no windowed list mounted | Nothing windows. |

The last row is the one exception to the paragraph above: it is a raw `console.error`, fired from a
`setTimeout(..., 0)` inside an effect and outside the once-per-key ledger, because the windowing
renderer registers from a layout effect and a synchronous check would report every correctly wired
cascader exactly once. Different channel, different ledger, same development-only gate.

### Advanced

Extension surface. Everything here is exported on purpose and is supported, but reaching for one of
these means you are building something the parts above do not ship: a custom trigger, a hand-laid-out
row, a windowed column, a test harness. Each entry gets a line of purpose rather than a prop table —
the parts above are where the prop tables live.

Lower-level parts. Each of these is rendered for you by a part above, or replaces one that is. Reach
for one only when you are laying that piece out yourself.

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CascaderBack` | The standalone back control, popping one level. `CascaderInput`'s `showBack` already renders one inline, so this is for a header you are composing yourself. Takes `children` (replacing the chevron) and `render`. Renders null at the root and outside `mode="drill"`. |
| `CascaderChip` | One chip, for a custom `CascaderChips` children list. Takes `node`, `showPath`, `maxSegments`, `showRemove`, `onRemove` and `children`. `onRemove` replaces Base UI's positional removal, which is exactly what a `strategy`-condensed chip needs, since its position no longer maps onto the stored array. |
| `CascaderColumnPanel` | The default single Miller column: its heading, its rows, and its own empty, loading and error state, because each column loads on its own. Takes `column`, `children` and `virtualized`. `CascaderColumns` renders one per column unless you fill its slot. |
| `CascaderVirtualColumn` | Windowed replacement for one Miller column, passed through the `CascaderColumns` children slot because each column scrolls independently. Takes `column`, `estimateSize` and `overscan`. |

Context hooks. The panel's internals are published on three contexts plus one external store,
because they change at very different rates. Subscribing to the narrowest one is what keeps a long
level cheap to type into: a keystroke rebuilds the entire derived view, and a component that only
reads configuration must not re-render for it.

`useCascaderActions()` and `useCascaderState()` THROW by name outside a `Cascader`, and so do the
three that read them: `useCascaderLoadState()`, `useCascaderHasActions()` and `useCascader()`. The
other two answer a harmless default instead — `useCascaderRender()` an empty object,
`useCascaderHighlight()` a shared fallback store reading `{ index: -1, value: null }` — because
neither has anything to fail loudly about.

| Hook | Republishes when | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `useCascaderActions()` | a config prop changes, and — for the five row predicates only — `items`, `selectable` or the selection | `index`, `mode`, `multiple`, `cascade`, `branchesSelectable`, `indicator`, `expandTrigger`, `actions`, `searchScope`, `maxHeight`, `inline`, `invalid`, `baseId`, `labels`, the windowing state (`virtualized`, `virtualize`, `virtualizeThreshold`, `estimateRowSize`, `overscan`, `registerVirtualRenderer`), and every callback: `setPath`, `pushLevel`, `popLevel`, `goToDepth`, `toggleExpanded`, `setQuery`, `setSelection`, `commit`, `navigate`, `navigateAt`, `resolveNode`, `isBranch`, `isSelectable`, `isSelected`, `isIndeterminate`, `selectedDescendantCount`, the flyout registry (`setFlyoutOpen`, `hasOpenFlyout`), the async members (`hasLoader`, `loadMore`, `retryLevel`, `invalidateLevel`), plus the `getIndex` / `getState` / `getHighlighted` getters |
| `useCascaderState()` | every keystroke, level change and selection | `index`, `path`, `expanded`, `query`, `currentParent`, `levelItems`, `deepResults`, `renderedItems`, `columns`, `treeRows`, `selectedValues`, `selectedDescendants`, `loadStates`, `searchState`, `announcement` |
| `useCascaderRender()` | the `renderItem` / `renderLabel` identities change | the two render props, always the current closure |
| `useCascaderHighlight()` | every arrow key and every pointer move over the list | `{ index, value }` of the highlighted row, `{ index: -1, value: null }` when nothing is |
| `useCascaderLoadState()` | whenever `useCascaderState()` does, since it reads it | `useCascaderLoadState(parent?: string \| null)` reads `loadStates` for you: pass a parent value, or nothing for the root. `null` for a level that has never been fetched, which is also what a cascader with no loader at all answers, so one null check covers both, and neither has to be told apart from a level that came back genuinely empty. |
| `useCascaderHasActions()` | whenever `useCascaderActions()` does, since it reads it | Whether the root was given any `actions`. `CascaderFooter` already renders nothing when there is nothing to draw; this is for a wrapper around it — a separator, a grid row — that has to make the same decision one level up. |
| `useCascader()` | Deprecated. every keystroke | The actions and state contexts merged into one `CascaderContextValue`, exactly as it always did, so an existing call site keeps compiling. It subscribes to BOTH, which is why anything calling it re-renders on every keystroke. Reach for `useCascaderActions()` or `useCascaderState()` in new code. |

```tsx
function LevelCount() {
  // Re-renders on every keystroke, which is exactly what this component is for.
  const { renderedItems } = useCascaderState()
  return <span>{renderedItems.length} results</span>
}

function ResetButton() {
  // Never re-renders while the user types: the actions context is stable.
  const { goToDepth, setQuery } = useCascaderActions()

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        goToDepth(0)
        setQuery("")
      }}
    >
      Back to the top
    </button>
  )
}
```

`invalidateLevel(value)` on the actions context evicts one branch's pages and load state, clears its
paging latch and aborts its in-flight request, so the level reads as never loaded and refetches the
next time it is on screen. `null` targets the root, and resolved chains and search hits are
deliberately untouched, so the trigger keeps its labels while the fresh page is in flight.

The highlight is an external store read through `useSyncExternalStore`, not context and not state. It
moves on every arrow key and on every pointer move across the list, so routing it through a re-render
would undo everything above. Read it with `useCascaderHighlight()` in the one component that needs
it, and use `getHighlighted()` from the actions context anywhere that only needs to ask inside an
event handler. `CascaderItem` is wrapped in `React.memo`, and `CascaderItems` hands each row its
`branch`, `selectable` and `selected` answers as props: that is what makes the memo hold, so typing
re-filters a level without re-rendering a single row whose own state did not change.

Types published on those hooks. Each is exported so a component taking one as a prop can name it.

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CascaderIndex` | The normalized view of the item tree, built once per `items` identity and published with the same identity on both contexts. Fields: `byValue`, `childrenOf`, `parentOf`, `depthOf`, `roots`, `all`. First argument of every helper below. |
| `CascaderFlatNode` | One row of the flattened tree-mode list, published as `treeRows`: `node`, `depth`, `branch`, `expanded`, `setSize`, `posInSet`. |
| `CascaderColumn` | One open level in `mode="columns"`, handed to the `CascaderColumns` children slot and taken as a prop by `CascaderColumnPanel` and `CascaderVirtualColumn`: `parent` (`null` at the root), `items` (already filtered), `depth`, `activeValue`, `active`. Only the `active` column is the listbox. |
| `CascaderHighlight` | What `useCascaderHighlight()` returns: `index` (`-1` when nothing is highlighted) and `value` (`null` then). Neither field is ever `undefined` and index `0` is a real row, so branch on `value === null` or `index === -1`. |

Pure helpers. `cascader-lib` holds the functions the primitive is built on. Fifteen of them answer
questions a hand-written row, trigger or chip list has to answer anyway, and re-deriving those by
hand is how a custom surface ends up disagreeing with the panel beside it. The tree and selection
functions take the `CascaderIndex` published on `useCascaderState()` as their first argument; the
matching and formatting ones need no index at all.

```tsx
import {
  collapseCascaderPath,
  findAmbiguousCascaderLabels,
  getCascaderPath,
} from "@/components/reui/cascader/cascader-lib"
```

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `getCascaderPath(index, value)` | Ancestor chain, root first and the node itself last. Empty for an unknown value, which is the normal case while async data is still loading. |
| `getCascaderChildren(index, parent?)` | One level's children. The root level for a nullish parent, so you never need the root sentinel key. |
| `collectCascaderSubtree(index, value)` | Every LOADED node under `value`, that node first and depth first after. Loaded is the same caveat `cascade` carries. |
| `isCascaderBranch(index, node)` | Known children, or a declared `hasChildren`. |
| `getCascaderCount(index, node)` | The trailing count. An explicit `count` on the node wins over the number of loaded children. |
| `isCascaderSelectable(index, node, selectable)` | Refuses the paging pseudo-node and a `disabled` node BEFORE consulting `selectable`, so neither can be overridden into selectability. |
| `getCascaderSelectedDescendants(index, selected)` | `Map<string, number>`: how many selected nodes each value has below it, at any depth. A value counts once for each ancestor and never for itself. |
| `getCascaderIndeterminate(index, selected)` | `Set<string>`: the values not selected themselves but with at least one selected descendant. That is the whole definition, derived here and never stored. |
| `getCascaderCheckedValues(index, selected, strategy)` | A `cascade` closure condensed for reporting: `"all"` as-is, `"parent"` keeps a value only when its parent is not selected, `"child"` only the deepest selected frontier. Derived output — the stored value stays the full closure. |
| `findAmbiguousCascaderLabels(nodes)` | `Set<string>`: the values whose label collides with another node in the same list. The rule `CascaderChips` applies per selection, and the one a hand-rolled chip list has to reproduce. |
| `normalizeCascaderQuery(query)` | Trims and folds a query once, so the cost hoists out of a per-node loop. |
| `matchesCascaderQuery(node, normalized)` | The default matcher: substring over the label plus any `keywords`. Expects an already normalized query, which is exactly what the `filter` prop receives. |
| `foldCascaderText(text)` | `toLocaleLowerCase`, so the Turkish dotted and dotless I fold the way that locale expects. Both sides of a match go through it. |
| `searchCascaderDeep(index, query, options?)` | Deep search over the index's depth-first order. `options.within` scopes it to one subtree, `options.limit` caps the results (200 by default), and `options.matches` swaps the matcher, defaulting to `matchesCascaderQuery`. |
| `collapseCascaderPath(path, options?)` | The collapsing the trigger and the breadcrumb both feed, so a custom trigger reads a deep path the same way they do. `options.maxSegments` defaults to `3`, `options.collapse` to `"middle"`. Returns `CascaderPathSegment[]`. |

Four more:

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `getCascaderMoreProps` | `getCascaderMoreProps(node, loadStates)` returns `{ loading, error, childrenLoading, childrenError }`, all booleans, from the `loadStates` map on `useCascaderState()`. Every renderer that lays rows out itself has to hand those four down, because `CascaderItem` is memoised and must not read the volatile state context. One call answers for both row kinds, which are mutually exclusive: a PAGING row reports the state of the level it belongs to, a BRANCH row the state of the level it OWNS. |
| `createCascaderHighlightStore` | Creates a `CascaderHighlightStore`. Each `Cascader` makes its own, so you never need this to use the primitive — it is there for tests and for a custom root that drives the highlight itself. |
| `useCascaderVirtualizer` | Not a context hook: it CREATES the virtualizer a windowed list drives, from `{ count, getScrollElement, estimateSize, overscan, getItemKey, activeIndex }`, and reads no cascader context at all. A plain TanStack virtualizer plus the two things a combobox list needs on top of it — `activeIndex` is clamped against `count` on every read, and the highlighted row is kept mounted while it is scrolled out of the window so `aria-activedescendant` never points at a removed node. Typed by `UseCascaderVirtualizerOptions` and `CascaderVirtualizer`. |
| `CASCADER_ROOT_KEY` | The NUL-prefixed sentinel keying root children in `index.childrenOf`, so no real node value can collide with it. Worth knowing only if you read `childrenOf` by hand; `getCascaderChildren(index)` with no parent answers the same question without it. |

```tsx
import { getCascaderMoreProps } from "@/components/reui/cascader/cascader-item"

const { loadStates } = useCascaderState()

<CascaderItem node={node} {...getCascaderMoreProps(node, loadStates)} />
```

### Internal exports

The eleven modules export more than the two tiers above. Those remaining symbols exist ONLY because
the registry ships one file per module and TypeScript needs cross-file access to them. They are not
public API, they carry no compatibility promise, and they are listed here so you can recognise one
when your editor offers it and reach for the documented equivalent instead.

- Raw contexts — `CascaderStateContext`, `CascaderActionsContext`, `CascaderRenderContext`,
  `CascaderHighlightContext`. Read them through their hooks instead: the first two throw a named
  error rather than handing back `undefined`, and the other two carry a safe default so a
  `useContext` of your own cannot get a bare `undefined` either.
- Class strings and sentinels — `CASCADER_ACTION_CLASS`, `CASCADER_LIST_HEIGHT_CLASS`,
  `CASCADER_LIST_PAD_CLASS`, `CASCADER_ROWS_CLASS`, `CASCADER_SCROLL_CLASS`, `CASCADER_MORE_PREFIX`,
  `CASCADER_LABELS`. The last is the English default bundle, which `labels` is shallow-merged over
  for you. `CASCADER_ROOT_KEY` is the one constant that is NOT internal — see [Advanced](#advanced).
- Index and traversal engine — `buildCascaderIndex`, `mergeCascaderIndex`, `flattenCascaderTree`,
  `filterCascaderLevel`, `applyCascadeSelection`, `getCascaderIndeterminateFrom`,
  `createCascaderMoreNode`, `isCascaderMoreNode`, `getCascaderMoreParent`. Calling one of these
  yourself produces a second answer the panel does not share.
- DOM and keyboard plumbing — `getCascaderFooterStops`, `getCascaderTabTarget`, `isCascaderRtl`.
- Development-only diagnostics — `warnCascaderOnce`, `resetCascaderWarnings`,
  `findCascaderDataIssues`, `CascaderDataIssues`. See [Development warnings](#development-warnings)
  for what they report.
- Label resolvers — `resolveCascaderLabels`, `resolveCascaderSearchLabel`. `labels` is resolved for
  you on the way into the context.
- The async engine — `useCascaderLoader`, `UseCascaderLoaderOptions`, `CascaderLoader`,
  `CascaderLoaderStore`. The root's own loader. Consumers reach it through the `getChildren`,
  `onSearch` and `resolveValue` root props, and through `loadMore` / `retryLevel` / `invalidateLevel`
  on the actions context.

## Keyboard

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↓` / `↑` | Move between rows in the current level. |
| `→` | Open the highlighted branch, when the caret is at the end of the query. |
| `←` | Go back one level, when the caret is at the start of the query. |
| `Backspace` | Go back one level, when the query is empty. |
| `Enter` | Commit the highlighted row, or open it if it is a branch. |
| `Home` / `End` | Move the CARET to the start or end of the query. They do not move the highlight: the field is a typeable `role="combobox"`, which is the case Base UI's list navigation deliberately leaves to the text caret. `↑` from the first row and `↓` from the last are the ends of the list. |
| `Esc` | Close the popup — or, while a footer flyout is open, close only the flyout. |
| `↓` past the last row | Hands focus to the footer commands, when a footer is composed. An empty result list hands off immediately, which is when "Create ..." is the useful thing on screen. |
| `↑` / `↓` in the footer | Walk the commands. Either end returns focus to the search field. The list highlight cleared on the way in — one active row at a time — so `↑` resumes at the last row and `↓` continues at the first. |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Move between the search field, any controls you put in the panel, and the footer commands. |

Arrow keys only navigate levels when the caret is already at the relevant edge of the search field,
so they never steal caret movement while you are editing a query. The level keys are logical, not
physical: under `dir="rtl"` `←` and `→` swap, in every mode. See [Right to left](#right-to-left).

### Tree mode keys

Branches expand in place rather than replacing the panel, so the level keys follow the APG tree
pattern instead:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `→` | Expand the highlighted branch. On a branch that is already expanded, move to its first child. |
| `←` | Collapse the highlighted branch. On a leaf, or on a branch that is already collapsed, move to its parent. |

### Footer flyout

A `CascaderSubmenu` is a real menu, not a popover with buttons in it: `role="menu"`, `menuitem`
entries, and roving focus rather than a Tab stop per command. In the footer strip itself the vertical
arrows move between commands — the flyout opens from the arrow that points at it, never from `↓`, so
the strip cannot stutter where the flyout row sits.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `→` | Open the flyout from its footer row and focus the first entry. `←` in RTL. |
| `↓` / `↑` | Move between entries once it is open. Wraps at both ends. |
| `Home` / `End` | First or last entry. |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Run the focused command. |
| `←` | Close the flyout and return focus to the row that opened it. `→` in RTL. |
| `Esc` | Close the flyout, leaving the cascader open. A second `Esc` closes that. |
| `Tab` | Close the flyout and carry on from the footer row. A menu never holds `Tab`. |
| a-z | Typeahead. Jumps to the next entry starting with what you type. |

Opening with the pointer parks focus on the flyout rather than on an entry, so a click never paints a
focus ring on a command nobody asked for; the arrow keys still work from there.

`Tab` is answered by `CascaderPanel` rather than left to the browser, and the reason is the scroll
area between the field and the footer: its viewport makes ITSELF tabbable whenever the content
overflows, so the footer sat one press away on a short level, two on a long one, and one more per
column in `mode="columns"` — each extra stop an unnamed `role="presentation"` div that drew a focus
ring around the whole list, which reads as "the footer is unreachable". The panel steps over that
viewport and moves focus between the panel's real controls in DOM order instead, so the footer is one
press away in every mode and in an embedded panel.

It never wraps and never traps: off either end there is no target, the key is left to the browser,
and leaving the cascader is what dismisses it. A `Tab` your own `onKeyDown` has already
default-prevented is left alone. The move itself is not announced — the control it lands on says what
it is, and a live-region message on every `Tab` would be noise.

## Accessibility

### Structure

- Built on Base UI's combobox, so the trigger and input carry the correct `role`, `aria-expanded`,
  `aria-controls` and `aria-activedescendant` wiring. An embedded panel (`inline`) supplies
  `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` itself, because it is permanently expanded and Base UI omits
  both in that case.
- The list's own role follows the mode: `role="listbox"` in drill and columns, `role="tree"` in
  `mode="tree"`. In columns mode the container around the panes is a `role="group"` named by
  `labels.columnsLabel`, and inside it exactly ONE pane is the listbox — the deepest, active one,
  which is the only pane Base UI owns. Every pane behind it is a `role="group"` named by its parent.
  So a screen reader hears levels of one control rather than several competing lists, and there is
  never a second listbox for the arrow keys to be ambiguous about.
- Every list and column is named after the level it is showing, falling back to `labels.rootLevel` at
  the root. The popup is named too, since Base UI gives it `role="dialog"` once the search input
  lives inside it.
- The in-panel breadcrumb is a `nav` named by `labels.breadcrumbLabel`. Its ancestors are buttons
  that navigate; the last segment is the level currently being listed, so it is not pressable and
  carries `aria-current="page"`.
- Row ARIA is per mode. `role="option"` allows a far narrower set of attributes than
  `role="treeitem"`, so the same row exposes different things depending on where it is rendered:

| Attribute | drill | columns (active) | columns (trail) | tree |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `role` | `option` | `option` | `button` | `treeitem` |
| `aria-selected` | yes | yes | — | yes |
| `aria-checked` | `mixed` only | `mixed` only | — | `mixed` only |
| `aria-setsize` / `aria-posinset` | yes | yes | — | yes |
| `aria-level` | — | — | — | yes |
| `aria-expanded` | — | — | the open row | branches |
| `aria-haspopup` | branches | branches | — | — |
| `aria-controls` | — | — | the open row | — |

- The chevron and the tree expander are pointer affordances, not controls: no `role`, no `tabIndex`,
  `aria-hidden`. A focusable element inside a `role="option"` row is a `nested-interactive`
  violation, and neither could take focus in any case, because focus stays in the search input. `→`
  is the keyboard path into a branch and `←` the way back out. The tree row itself carries
  `aria-expanded`, so its expander announcing the same state again would be noise.

### Names and announcements

- A branch's accessible name spells out what the visual row only implies: "Person, 24 items,
  submenu" rather than "Person 24". The visible count and the chevron are `aria-hidden`, so nothing is
  announced twice. Once something inside the branch is selected the visible number switches to that
  count and takes the accent color, and the name says so in words — "Person, 24 items, 3 selected,
  submenu" — because a color is not an announcement.
- `CascaderStatus` is the only live region. It announces level changes, a return to the root, tree
  expand and collapse, result counts, and the two presses whose effect is otherwise invisible: a pick
  refused past `max` (`labels.maxReachedAnnouncement`) and a `cascade` commit's fan-out over a subtree
  that is mostly off screen (`labels.cascadeAnnouncement`). It is built on Base UI's `Combobox.Status`
  so it inherits the initial text mutation that makes Safari and VoiceOver read the first announcement
  at all.
- Result counts count MATCHES, not rows: the ancestor rows a filtered tree keeps as context and the
  paging row are excluded, and server search hits are counted as-is, since the server matched them on
  data the client cannot see. The count is also the one announcement that defers — a keystroke
  rewrites it, so it waits about 150ms of quiet while everything event-shaped (a level change, a load
  settling, a refusal) announces immediately.
- A level announcement numbers its level one-based, matching the `aria-level` tree mode gives the
  same rows, so the spoken numbering and the ARIA numbering can never disagree by one.
- The paging row is a real option rather than a DOM-only row, so it is arrow reachable and counted by
  `aria-setsize`. It is never selectable, and its retry affordance is plain text rather than a button.
- The loading spinner on a branch row is `aria-hidden`. The load state is spoken once, by
  `CascaderStatus`, which announces `loading`, `loadingMore` and `error` ahead of any result count —
  so a level that is still fetching is never announced as having no results. `searchingAnnouncement`
  is announcement-only, named apart from `loadingMore` because a search is not the next page of
  anything.
- The search input is described by a visually hidden `labels.keyboardHint` for the current mode AND
  writing direction — the level keys mirror in RTL, so the hint names the mirrored pair there — and
  it is the only thing that advertises the level keys; nothing on screen does.
- The footer is a `role="group"` named by `labels.actionsLabel`, so its buttons do not read as more
  options, and a submenu trigger appends `labels.submenuAffordance` so it is not announced identically
  to a plain command. The footer is a deterministic `Tab` destination: `CascaderPanel` owns the
  panel's tab order and steps over the scroll area's viewport, which makes itself tabbable whenever a
  level overflows, so the number of presses between the search field and the commands does not change
  with the length of the list, the mode, or whether the panel is embedded. The flyout is a real
  popover with its own focus management, reachable by `Tab` from the footer row. See
  [Footer flyout](#footer-flyout).
- A partially selected branch under `cascade` carries `aria-checked="mixed"` — one of the four
  attributes `role="option"` allows on top of the globals, and one `role="treeitem"` takes too. It is
  only ever set when it is `mixed`: a plain selected row already says so with `aria-selected`, and two
  selection attributes on one row is noise. Columns-trail rows are `role="button"`, which allows
  neither, so for those the state is spelled out in the accessible name via
  `labels.partiallySelectedState`.
- The chips container is a named `role="toolbar"` WHENEVER it holds chips, and every remove button
  carries `labels.removeChip(label)`. An icon-only remove button with no name is announced as
  "button", once per selection. Base UI drops the role on an empty selection, where there is nothing
  to arrow between and the container is showing its placeholder; the `labels.chipsLabel` name stays
  either way.
- Disabled nodes are `aria-disabled` rather than removed from the accessibility tree.
- The level keys mirror under `dir="rtl"`. The check gutter and the check itself need no mirror: both
  are driven by `--cascader-row-inset` through logical properties. See
  [Right to left](#right-to-left).
- Every string in the lists above comes from `labels`, so the accessible surface translates alongside
  the visible one. See [Labels](#labels) for the full key list.

### Deliberately not done

Each of these is a place where the obvious thing is the wrong thing, so none of them is an oversight
to be fixed.

- Focus is never moved into the list. No roving `tabIndex`, no focusable rows, no per-row tab stop.
  This is a combobox: the field keeps focus and the list is addressed through
  `aria-activedescendant`, which is also what lets typing keep working while the highlight moves.
- `CascaderSeparator` is decorative. A `listbox` may not own a `role="separator"`, and a run that
  needs separating for a screen reader needs a `CascaderGroup`, not a line.
- `CascaderEmpty` has no live region of its own. It would be a second announcement of what
  `CascaderStatus` has already said, so an empty level is announced once rather than twice.
- The paging row carries no button. Its retry is the row's own text, because a focusable element
  inside a `role="option"` row is a `nested-interactive` violation. The retry inside `CascaderEmpty`
  IS a real button, since that element sits outside the listbox — and the footer flyout is the one
  place a real menu with real focus management lives inside the popup, which is exactly why it is a
  popover rather than part of the list.

## Base UI vs Radix UI

Detect your build from `components.json` -> `style`: `base-nova` -> Base UI (this file's default),
`radix-nova` -> Radix UI.

This is one of the two components (with Filters) where the diff is larger than an import path. Real
differences, confirmed by diffing the two mirrored pages:

- **Which parts take `asChild` vs `render`, and the set differs by one part.** Base UI: five parts
  take `render` (`CascaderPanel`, `CascaderNav`, `CascaderBack`, `CascaderBreadcrumb`,
  `CascaderValue`), plus thirteen more Base UI parts that also take `render`
  (`CascaderTrigger`, `CascaderContent`, `CascaderInput`, `CascaderList`, `CascaderEmpty`,
  `CascaderStatus`, `CascaderItem`, `CascaderChips`, `CascaderChip`, `CascaderGroup`,
  `CascaderLabel`, `CascaderSeparator`, `CascaderSubmenuContent`). Radix UI: **six** parts take
  `asChild` — the same five plus `CascaderStatus` — while the Radix registry's combobox is itself
  Base UI-backed, so `CascaderTrigger`, `CascaderContent`, `CascaderInput`, `CascaderList`,
  `CascaderEmpty`, `CascaderItem`, `CascaderChips`, `CascaderChip`, `CascaderGroup`, `CascaderLabel`,
  `CascaderSeparator` and `CascaderSubmenuContent` (twelve, `CascaderStatus` moved out of this list)
  still take Base UI's own `render` prop even on the Radix build.
- **`asChild` semantics differ per part**, not just the prop name:
  - `CascaderPanel`, `CascaderNav`: `asChild` merges props onto the single child instead of
    rendering a `div`.
  - `CascaderBack`: same idea (chevron replaced by `children`).
  - `CascaderValue`: on Radix, `children` becomes `((selected, path) => ReactNode) | ReactElement` —
    a callback replaces the whole rendering as before, OR with `asChild` set, `children` must be the
    single element the display is cloned into. Falls back to `span` when `children` is not an
    element.
  - `CascaderBreadcrumb`: on Radix, `children` becomes `ReactElement` (ignored without `asChild`);
    `asChild` clones the trail into it, falling back to `nav` if `children` is not an element "so the
    `aria-label` is never lost."
  - `CascaderStatus`: on Radix, `asChild` merges props onto its single child instead of rendering a
    `div`, but **only engages when `children` is an ELEMENT** — with the announcement string as
    children instead, Radix's `Slot` can't clone it and would delete the live region silently, so the
    `div` is kept in that case. This part additionally still accepts Base UI's own `render` prop too
    (since `CascaderStatus` is a Base UI `Combobox.Status` in both builds), and an explicit `render`
    wins over `asChild` when both are set.
- Two of the six Radix `asChild` parts BUILD their own children (`CascaderValue` renders the
  collapsed path, `CascaderBreadcrumb` renders the trail): with `asChild`, those children are cloned
  INTO the element you pass, so the element is a container, not a replacement, and whatever children
  it was written with are discarded in favor of the part's own.
- `CascaderBack`'s Advanced-tier entry: Base UI takes `render`; Radix takes `asChild`.
- Marketing copy differs ("Base UI primitives from @base-ui/react" vs "the Radix UI implementation
  with accessible primitives from the Radix stack").

Everything else — the full `Cascader` root prop table (including single/multi-select arms), every
other part's prop table (`CascaderTrigger`, `CascaderContent`, `CascaderInput`, `CascaderItem`,
`CascaderEmpty`, `CascaderFooter`, `CascaderAction`, `CascaderSubmenu`, `CascaderSubmenuTrigger`,
`CascaderSubmenuContent`, `CascaderChips`, `CascaderColumns`, `CascaderVirtualItems`), every Type,
every Hook, the Guides (Forms, Right to left, Labels, Development warnings), Advanced, Internal
exports, Keyboard, and Accessibility — is identical text between the two builds.
