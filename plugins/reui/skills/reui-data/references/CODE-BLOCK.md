## Installation

```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @reui/code-block
```

(npm/yarn/bun equivalents: `npx shadcn@latest add @reui/code-block`, `yarn dlx shadcn@latest add
@reui/code-block`, `bunx shadcn@latest add @reui/code-block`.)

The only npm dependency is `shiki`. Grammars and themes load lazily, one chunk per language, and
nothing loads at all when you pass pre-highlighted lines or turn highlighting off.

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  CodeBlock,
  CodeBlockCopyButton,
  CodeBlockHeader,
  CodeBlockLanguage,
  CodeBlockTitle,
} from "@/components/reui/code-block/code-block"
```

```tsx
<CodeBlock code={code} language="tsx" />
```

That is a complete block. Everything else is composition:

```tsx
<CodeBlock code={code} language="tsx" showLineNumbers>
  <CodeBlockHeader>
    <CodeBlockTitle>use-totals.ts</CodeBlockTitle>
    <CodeBlockLanguage />
    <CodeBlockCopyButton className="ml-auto" />
  </CodeBlockHeader>
</CodeBlock>
```

## Anatomy

`CodeBlock` renders the code surface itself; with the default surface, children are chrome (a header,
a copy button, an expand control) and their order never matters. Composing `CodeBlockContent` makes
the surface one of the children, and from then on order is DOM order.

```tsx
<CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlockHeader>
    <CodeBlockTitle />
    <CodeBlockLanguage />
    <CodeBlockWrapToggle />
    <CodeBlockCopyButton />
  </CodeBlockHeader>
  <CodeBlockContent /> {/* optional: compose inside your own ScrollArea */}
  <CodeBlockExpandButton />
  <CodeBlockLineActions>{({ line }) => null}</CodeBlockLineActions>
</CodeBlock>
```

A `CodeBlockCopyButton` inside a header is a normal flex child. Outside one it pins itself over the
surface and stays put under both vertical and horizontal scrolling.

## Framing

The default variant draws a bordered surface. Use `variant="ghost"` when something else already
provides the chrome, so you do not get a doubled border. Ghost keeps the block's own padding; a flush
fit is the container's job (`p-0` on the panel, as the framed examples do).

```tsx
<Card>
  <CardContent>
    <CodeBlock code={code} language="tsx" variant="ghost" />
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

Full example (tabs switching between framed, ghost `CodeBlock`s inside one `Frame`) is in
[CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#framing](./CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#framing).

## Scrolling

`CodeBlockContent` is the code surface as a composable part: place it inside your own scroll container
and the block stops scrolling internally — the ancestor owns both axes.

By default the block scrolls with a plain `overflow: auto` container of its own — no ScrollArea
dependency, native thin scrollbars, and `maxLines` caps it.

To own the scrolling yourself, compose `CodeBlockContent` inside your own scroll container. The
ancestor takes BOTH axes — the surface scrolls nothing itself — and a header above the area never
scrolls away. The sticky line numbers anchor to the ancestor's viewport, and stick-to-bottom during
streaming follows it automatically. Pass a `ScrollBar orientation="horizontal"` child for the
horizontal bar; Base UI positions it against the scroll area's root, so it stays pinned even though it
sits among the children.

```tsx
<CodeBlock code={code} language="tsx" showLineNumbers>
  <CodeBlockHeader>
    <CodeBlockTitle>use-totals.ts</CodeBlockTitle>
    <CodeBlockCopyButton className="ml-auto" />
  </CodeBlockHeader>
  <ScrollArea className="rounded-[inherit] **:data-[slot=scroll-area-viewport]:max-h-72">
    <CodeBlockContent />
    <ScrollBar orientation="horizontal" />
  </ScrollArea>
</CodeBlock>
```

Use `max-h-*`, not a fixed height, so a short file does not leave dead space, and put it on the
ScrollArea VIEWPORT (as above): the viewport is height-100% of the root, and a percentage against a
max-height-only parent resolves to auto, so a root-level cap clips without ever scrolling. `maxLines`
still marks the block collapsible, so `CodeBlockExpandButton` works either way; only the height cap
itself belongs to the built-in viewport. To collapse a composed surface, read `expanded` from
`useCodeBlockConfig` and cap your own ScrollArea, as the expand example does. `CodeBlockContent` must
appear in the JSX you pass to `CodeBlock` — any depth, any wrapper, your own components included. It
is invisible only when a child component CONSTRUCTS it internally instead of receiving it as children,
and development logs an error if that happens.

Full worked example (design-token theme via CSS variables, composed ScrollArea) is in
[CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#scrolling](./CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#scrolling).

The inverse composition also works — default-mode blocks that size to content, listed inside one
outer ScrollArea that scrolls the whole set — and ships as a changed-file list on the Code Block
components page (not reproduced here; the upstream page only references it, it does not print its
code on this page).

## Server rendering

`highlightCode` lives in its own module with no `"use client"` directive, so a server component can
call it. The result is plain JSON, so it crosses the boundary as data and the browser never downloads
a grammar.

```tsx
import { CodeBlock } from "@/components/reui/code-block/code-block"
import { highlightCode } from "@/components/reui/code-block/code-block-highlight"

export default async function Page() {
  const lines = await highlightCode(source, { language: "tsx" })

  return (
    <CodeBlock lines={lines} showLineNumbers>
      <CodeBlockHeader>
        <CodeBlockCopyButton value={source} />
      </CodeBlockHeader>
    </CodeBlock>
  )
}
```

The same shape works without React Server Components. In Remix or TanStack Start, return `lines` from
a loader and pass them to the component.

```tsx
export async function loader() {
  return { lines: await highlightCode(source, { language: "tsx" }) }
}
```

`lines` is a plain array, so any highlighter can produce it. If you already use Prism or
highlight.js, map its output to `CodeBlockLine[]` and the component never loads shiki.

## Streaming and AI SDK

Pass a `code` string that grows. The component re-tokenizes on a deferred value, and the highlighter
returns the same line objects for lines that did not change, so an appended chunk re-renders one line
rather than the whole file. Lines past what the highlighter has caught up to render as plain text, so
the newest token is visible immediately.

```tsx
<CodeBlock code={partial} language="tsx" streaming={status === "streaming"} />
```

`streaming` is presentational: it shows an underline caret, sticks the viewport to the bottom until
the reader scrolls up, sets `aria-busy`, and turns on motion. New lines slide in once; tokens
deliberately do not animate, because the highlighter runs a chunk behind the stream and replaces plain
lines with tokenized ones — colour arriving instantly reads as highlighting, while a mount-keyed fade
re-flashed lines that were already readable. The animation is compositor-only and honours
`prefers-reduced-motion`. Incremental rendering is always memoized, so forgetting the prop costs
correctness nothing.

Full worked example (simulated AI SDK stream with a Complete/Generating badge) is in
[CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#streaming-and-ai-sdk](./CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#streaming-and-ai-sdk).

### Markdown code fences

Most AI chat UIs do not hold a raw code string. They hold a markdown message with fenced blocks in
it. Two helpers cover both routes.

Rendering a message yourself, `markdownFences` splits it into prose and code and reports a fence
whose closing delimiter has not streamed in yet:

```tsx
{
  markdownFences(message.text).map((part, index) =>
    part.type === "text" ? (
      <p key={index}>{part.content}</p>
    ) : (
      <CodeBlock
        key={index}
        code={part.content}
        language={part.language}
        streaming={part.open}
      >
        <CodeBlockCopyButton />
      </CodeBlock>
    )
  )
}
```

Using react-markdown or Streamdown, `markdownCodeProps` reads the language and the source out of the
props given to `pre`:

```tsx
function MarkdownPre(props: React.ComponentProps<"pre">) {
  const { code, language } = markdownCodeProps(props)
  return (
    <CodeBlock code={code} language={language}>
      <CodeBlockCopyButton />
    </CodeBlock>
  )
}

;<ReactMarkdown components={{ pre: MarkdownPre }}>{message.text}</ReactMarkdown>
```

An unknown language and an unterminated fence both render as plain text rather than throwing, which is
what a half-streamed message always looks like.

Full worked example (chat transcript streaming a fenced reply via `markdownFences`) is in
[CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#markdown-code-fences](./CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#markdown-code-fences).

## Bundle and CSP

The highlighter uses shiki's JavaScript regex engine, not oniguruma. There is no WebAssembly, so
installing this does not force `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` into your Content Security Policy.

- shiki loads on first highlight, never on import.
- Each language is its own chunk, resolved through a static map.
- `highlight={false}` and the `lines` prop never request any of it.

## Adding a language

Languages are a written-out map in `code-block-highlight.tsx`. Add a line:

```tsx
export const codeBlockLanguages = {
  // ...
  elixir: () => import("shiki/langs/elixir.mjs"),
}
```

Aliases resolve first, so shorthands live one map up: add `ex: "elixir"` to `LANGUAGE_ALIASES` and
both names work. An entry does not have to come from shiki either — `mylang: () =>
import("./my-grammar.json")` registers a custom TextMate grammar, since the loader feeds
`loadLanguage` directly. Anything unresolved renders as plain text.

The map is written out on purpose. Building the specifier from a template literal instead makes
bundlers emit a context module containing every grammar shiki ships, which quietly turns a lean
install into a very large one.

## Theming

Three levels, from zero effort to full control:

- Defaults. Blocks ship with `github-light` / `github-dark` and switch with your site theme
  automatically.
- Any shiki theme. Register it in `codeBlockThemes` in the copied `code-block-highlight.tsx` (one
  line, lazy-loaded), then pass `themes={{ light: "vitesse-light", dark: "vitesse-dark" }}`. Changing
  the two defaults in that file restyles every block at once. An unregistered name falls back to its
  side's default and warns in development — check the `codeBlockThemes` entry first when a block
  renders in the wrong palette.
- Design tokens. Pass the built-in `css-variables` theme and the palette moves into your stylesheet:
  every token colour becomes a `var(--code-token-*)` reference, so highlighting follows your design
  system in both modes with no theme JSON at all.

```tsx
<CodeBlock
  code={code}
  language="tsx"
  themes={{ light: "css-variables", dark: "css-variables" }}
/>
```

```css
:root {
  --code-token-keyword: var(--color-rose-600);
  --code-token-function: var(--color-violet-600);
  --code-token-string: var(--color-emerald-600);
  --code-token-constant: var(--color-sky-600);
  --code-token-parameter: var(--color-amber-600);
  --code-token-comment: var(--color-muted-foreground);
  --code-token-punctuation: var(--color-foreground);
}

.dark {
  --code-token-keyword: var(--color-rose-400);
  /* ...and so on for the dark side of each token */
}
```

The full variable set: `--code-foreground`, and `--code-token-constant`, `-string`, `-comment`,
`-keyword`, `-parameter`, `-function`, `-string-expression`, `-punctuation`, `-link`.

Blocks with different `themes` props coexist on one page; each theme loads once, by name, on first
use.

The design-token example is the one embedded under Scrolling above (see
[CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#scrolling](./CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#scrolling)), and it also lives on the Code
Block components page.

### Dark Theme

Code often stays dark even on a light page. Wrap the block in a `dark` scope and every semantic token
inside follows; the primitive needs nothing.

```tsx
<div className="dark">
  <CodeBlock code={code} language="tsx" />
</div>
```

Full worked example (a marketing hero snippet forced dark, combining highlighted lines/words, diff,
and all three diagnostic levels at once) is in
[CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#dark-theme](./CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md#dark-theme).

## Examples

A representative six ship in full on the docs page (the rest — 15 more — stay browsable only on the
Code Block components page and are not reproduced in the mirrored markdown): Pinned copy button,
Diff, Nested code folding, Fix with AI on the failing line, Reference lines in chat, Unified patch
review. Full source for all six, plus the anatomy/framing/scrolling/streaming/dark-theme examples
above and the two API-reference/accessibility demo snippets, is in
[CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md](./CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md).

"The rest" — per the page, ship exactly the same way and stay browsable on the Code Block components
page: ANSI terminal output, a tool-call payload, live search with a match counter, focus walkthroughs,
line selection, soft wrap, an expand control over a long file, pre-highlighted server lines,
before-and-after panes, a language switcher, a shiki transformer diff, highlighted words, a dark
terminal, patch review with accept and reject actions, and a changed-file list inside one scroll area.
The upstream page names these but does not print their code here.

## API Reference

### CodeBlock

The root. Renders the code surface; children are chrome.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |

| `transformers` | `ShikiTransformer[]` | — | Passed to shiki. Line classes become line state. |
| `streaming` | `boolean` | `false` | Caret, stick-to-bottom, `aria-busy`. |
| `expanded` | `boolean` | — | Collapsed state under `maxLines`, controlled. |
| `defaultExpanded` | `boolean` | `false` | Collapsed state, uncontrolled. |

| `completeAnnouncement` | `string` | derived | Screen-reader text when a stream finishes, for localisation. |
| `selectable` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables line selection. |
| `foldRegions` | `CodeBlockFoldRegion[]` | derived | Replaces the indentation heuristic with your own regions. |
| `foldable` | `boolean` | `false` | Detects fold regions from indentation and renders a toggle per region. |
| `folded` | `number[]` | — | Folded regions by start line, controlled. |
| `defaultFolded` | `number[]` | `[]` | Folded regions by start line, uncontrolled. |
| `onFoldedChange` | `(folded: number[]) => void` | — | Fired when a region folds or unfolds. |

| `defaultSelectedLines` | `number[]` | `[]` | Selected lines, uncontrolled. |
| `onSelectedLinesChange` | `(lines: number[]) => void` | — | Fired on selection change. |

Line specs address source lines, 1-based within `code`, so changing `startLine` never invalidates
them.

### CodeBlockContent

The code surface as a standalone part. Compose it inside your own scroll container and the block
renders no internal scroller; omit it and the block scrolls itself exactly as before. Takes only
`className`.

### CodeBlockCopyButton

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `value` | `string` | root `code` | Text to copy. Notation comments are stripped. |
| `onCopy` | `(value: string) => void` | — | Fired after a successful copy. |
| `timeout` | `number` | `2000` | How long the copied state lasts. `0` keeps it. |
| `position` | `"auto" \| "pinned" \| "inline"` | `"auto"` | `auto` is inline in a header, pinned elsewhere. |
| `onCopyError` | `(error: unknown) => void` | — | Fired when the clipboard write rejects. |
| `labels` | `{ copy?, copied? }` | English | Accessible names, for localisation. |
| `alwaysVisible` | `boolean` | `false` | Skips the hover reveal when pinned. |

### CodeBlockDownloadButton

Saves the block's code as a file — the sibling of the copy button for builder-style output. Same
`position` contract; `filename` defaults to `code.<ext>` from the block's language.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `value` | `string` | block code | Text to save, notation stripped. |
| `filename` | `string` | derived | Name for the saved file. |
| `onDownload` | `(filename: string) => void` | — | Fired after the save starts. |
| `position` | `"auto" \| "pinned" \| "inline"` | `"auto"` | Same placement contract as copy. |
| `label` | `string` | English | Accessible name, for localisation. |

### CodeBlockLineActions

| Prop | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | — | `({ line, text, state }) => ReactNode` | Rendered on the active line. |
| `side` | `"end"` | `"end" \| "gutter"` | `end` floats the group over the end of the row; `gutter` centres it on the row's start edge, half over the numbers, without reserving any space. A fold toggle owns that edge, so a gutter action on a fold-start row falls back to `end`. |

### CodeBlockExpandButton

Renders nothing when the content is shorter than `maxLines`, so it is always safe to compose.

### useCodeBlockConfig

`useCodeBlockConfig(partName)` — the string only names your component in the "must be used within a
CodeBlock" error. Returns the block's own config for anything composed inside it: `code`, `language`,
`resolvedLanguage`, `showLineNumbers`, `wrap` / `setWrap`, `expanded` / `setExpanded`, `collapsible`,
`streaming` and `contentId`.

### useCodeBlockFolding

Live folding for anything composed inside the block: `regions`, `foldedStarts`, `toggleFold`,
`foldAll`, `unfoldAll` and `foldable`. Numbers are source-based like every line spec.

### useCodeBlockSelection

Live selection for anything composed inside the block — a line action or a header control. Returns
`selectedLines` (sorted), `toggleLine`, `clearSelection` and `selectable`, so an "add selection to
chat" affordance can act on the whole range instead of only the hovered line.

### Helpers

| Export | From | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `highlightCode` | `code-block-highlight` | `(code, options) => Promise<CodeBlockLine[]>` | Isomorphic. Safe in a server component. |
| `markdownFences` | `code-block` | `(markdown) => CodeBlockMarkdownPart[]` | Splits prose from fenced code; flags an unclosed fence. |
| `markdownCodeProps` | `code-block` | `(preProps) => { code, language }` | Reads a react-markdown `pre`. |
| `parseLineSpec` | `code-block-highlight` | `(spec) => Set<number>` | `"2-4,7"` to line numbers. |
| `stripNotationComments` | `code-block-highlight` | `(code) => string` | Removes `[!code ...]` comments. |
| `ansiToLines` | `code-block` | `(text, startLine?) => CodeBlockLine[]` | Terminal SGR colours to renderable lines. |
| `parseUnifiedDiff` | `code-block` | `(patch) => CodeBlockPatchFile[]` | A git patch to per-file lines with dual gutters. |

The upstream table prints `highlightCode`'s return type simply as `Promise` (no type argument shown);
`parseLineSpec`'s return type simply as `Set` (no type argument shown). Recorded verbatim above with
the type argument inferred from context (`CodeBlockLine[]`, `number`) added only where the surrounding
prose states it unambiguously elsewhere on the page.

## Data attributes

State is published as attributes, so styling never needs `!important` and never needs a `:has()`
selector.

| `data-foldable` | root | present when folding is enabled |
| `data-gutter-channel` | root | present when folding reserves the gutter channel |
| `data-code-line` | line | the displayed line number |
| `data-highlighted` | line | present when marked |
| `data-diff` | line | `add`, `remove` |
| `data-focused` / `data-blurred` | line | focus mode |
| `data-level` | line | `error`, `warning`, `info` |
| `data-selected` | line | present when selected |
| `data-active` | line | present under the keyboard/hover cursor |
| `data-gutter` | line | a verbatim gutter label (patch old/new pairs) |
| `data-code-line-numbers` | pre | present when the gutter renders |
| `data-wrap` | pre | present while soft-wrapping |
| `data-selectable` | pre | present when line selection is on |
| `data-word` | token | the matched word on a marked token |
| `data-position` | copy / download | `pinned`, `inline` |
| `data-copied` | copy button | present during the copied beat |
| `data-copy-failed` | copy button | present for 2s after a rejected write |
| `data-state` | fold toggle | `folded`, `unfolded` |
| `data-state` | wrap toggle | `on`, `off` |
| `data-state` | expand | `expanded`, `collapsed` |
| `data-side` | line actions | `end`, `gutter` |

## Keyboard

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Tab | Moves into the scroll region, which is a tab stop. |
| ↑ ↓ | Moves the active line when `selectable`. |
| Shift + ↑ ↓ | Extends the selection. |
| Enter / Space | Toggles the active line's selection in place. |
| Home / End | Moves the active line to the first or last rendered line. |
| Esc | Clears the active line, when `selectable`. |
| Enter / Space | Folds or unfolds the region when a fold toggle has focus. |

## Accessibility

- With the built-in surface, the scroll container is a labelled `region` and a tab stop, so it can be
  scrolled without a pointer. Composed, the keyboard scroll stop is your own container, which then
  needs its own accessible name.
- With `selectable`, the code is a `listbox` and each line an `option` carrying `aria-selected`. The
  region wrapper holds the only `tabIndex={0}`, so the block is a single tab stop; with `selectable`,
  arrow keys move the active option and `aria-activedescendant` on that wrapper exposes it to
  assistive tech.
- Line numbers and diff glyphs are generated content, so they are outside the accessibility tree and
  outside text selection: copying gives exact source.
- Streaming sets `aria-busy` and announces completion once through a polite status. The code is
  deliberately not a live region, which would otherwise narrate every token.

Two more example snippets illustrate the API Reference and Accessibility sections directly; both are
in [CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md](./CODE-BLOCK-EXAMPLES.md).

## Base UI vs Radix UI

Detect your build from `components.json` -> `style`: `base-nova` -> Base UI (this file's default),
`radix-nova` -> Radix UI.

The upstream pages state no prop, import-path, or behavioural difference between the two builds for
Code Block. The only diff found between the two mirrored pages is marketing copy ("These examples use
Base UI primitives from @base-ui/react..." vs "These examples follow the Radix UI implementation with
accessible primitives from the Radix stack..."). Install command, import path
(`@/components/reui/code-block/code-block`), every prop table, every data attribute, the keyboard
table, and every example's code are identical text between the two builds.
