Custom Shadcn Event Calendar for React and Tailwind CSS. A headless-first event calendar with month,
week, day, N-day and agenda views, drag-and-drop scheduling, recurring events, time zones, and an
external CRUD contract.

Free component — no licence key required. This primitive also powers 6 ready-made ReUI Pro blocks
(complete event calendar sections built on top of this component); those blocks are premium and out
of scope for this reference.

The `event-calendar` package separates the calendar engine from the calendar UI. A subscribable store
(`useEventCalendarState`) owns events, view, date, selection, and interactions with controlled and
uncontrolled modes for every state pair; the shipped view components (month, week, day, N-days,
agenda, and a resource day grid) render from that store through fine-grained selector hooks. Events
are yours: the calendar never persists anything, it proposes changes through `onEventUpdate` and you
accept, adjust, or reject them.

The composition contract is a provider plus slots: `<EventCalendar>` wraps `<EventCalendarNav />`, an
optional `<EventCalendarToolbar />`, and `<EventCalendarContent />`. Recurrence (an RFC 5545 subset,
structured rules or raw `RRULE` strings), display time zones via `@date-fns/tz`, pointer-based drag,
resize, and drag-create, and per-key i18n overrides are built in.

## Installation

```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @reui/event-calendar
```

(npm/yarn/bun equivalents: `npx shadcn@latest add @reui/event-calendar`, `yarn dlx shadcn@latest add
@reui/event-calendar`, `bunx shadcn@latest add @reui/event-calendar`.)

## Usage

```tsx
import { EventCalendar } from "@/components/reui/event-calendar/event-calendar"
import { EventCalendarContent } from "@/components/reui/event-calendar/event-calendar-content"
import { EventCalendarNav } from "@/components/reui/event-calendar/event-calendar-nav"
import type { CalendarEvent } from "@/components/reui/event-calendar/event-calendar-types"
```

```tsx
const [events, setEvents] = useState<CalendarEvent[]>(initialEvents)

return (
  <EventCalendar
    events={events}
    onEventsChange={setEvents}
    defaultView="week"
    className="h-[600px]"
  >
    <EventCalendarNav />
    <EventCalendarContent />
  </EventCalendar>
)
```

Pass `defaultEvents` for uncontrolled state or `events` + `onEventsChange` for controlled state; the
same pairing exists for `view`, `date`, `dayCount`, `selection`, `interactions`, and `viewSettings`.
In the default `scrollMode="contained"` the calendar fills its container and scrolls internally, so
give the root an explicit height (the examples use `h-[560px]`). Every timing change, whether from a
drag, a resize, or `api.updateEvent`, funnels through `onEventUpdate`: return `false` to reject and
revert, return nothing (or `true`) to accept, or return `{ start, end, allDay }` to accept with an
adjustment, then persist to your backend from `onEventsChange` or inside `onEventUpdate` itself. Use
`onRangeChange` to fetch remote events for the visible range, and `apiRef` (or a hoisted
`useEventCalendarState` instance passed as `calendar`) for imperative control from outside the tree.

## API Reference

### EventCalendar

The root provider and container. It creates (or adopts) the calendar instance, provides it via
context, and renders a flex-column `div` (customizable through `render`). Besides the props below, it
accepts every option and callback listed under [State options](#state-options), [Callbacks](#callbacks),
and every display prop listed under [View configuration](#view-configuration).

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `calendar` | `EventCalendarInstance` | — | Adopt a hoisted `useEventCalendarState` instance; option props are then ignored (a dev warning fires if both are passed). |
| `apiRef` | `RefObject<EventCalendarApi \| null>` | — | Imperative escape hatch; receives the instance API for use outside the tree. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Composed slots, typically `EventCalendarNav`, `EventCalendarToolbar`, and `EventCalendarContent`. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes for the root element. |
| `render` | `useRender` render prop | — | Replace the rendered root element. |

### EventCalendarNav

Default composed navigation: Today, view switcher, prev/next, title, and a trailing spacer. Pass
`children` to use it as a pure layout shell and compose the nav parts yourself. Renders as a `div`
with `useRender` support.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `showViewSwitcher` | `boolean` | `true` | Render the view switcher in the composed layout; turn off for fixed-view embeds. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Replaces the default composed layout entirely. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes for the nav container. |

### EventCalendarNavToday

The "Today" navigation button; resets the calendar to now. It follows the configured
`navButtonVariant` / `navButtonSize` and the `classNames.navButton` hook, and gets `data-active` while
the anchor period contains now. `EventCalendarNavPrev` and `EventCalendarNavNext` share the same
props.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tooltip` | `ReactNode \| null` | — | Hover/focus-visible hint. Today defaults to the current date; Prev/Next default to their i18n labels. Pass `null` to disable this one button. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Replaces the default label or chevron icon. |
| `render` | `useRender` render prop | — | Replace the rendered button element. |

### EventCalendarNavPrev

The previous-period navigation button; steps the anchor date one period back for the current view.
Same props as `EventCalendarNavToday`, except `tooltip` defaults to the i18n "previous" label and
`children` replaces the default chevron icon.

### EventCalendarNavNext

The next-period navigation button; steps the anchor date one period forward for the current view.
Same props as `EventCalendarNavToday`, except `tooltip` defaults to the i18n "next" label and
`children` replaces the default chevron icon.

### EventCalendarTitle

The current period title (from `i18n.functions.formatTitle`), marked `aria-live="polite"`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `format` | `(ctx: { title: string }) => ReactNode` | — | Wrap or transform the computed title text. |

### EventCalendarViewSwitcher

Dropdown listing the available views (the resolved `views` option) with optional keyboard-shortcut
hints; when the `days` view is enabled, one item per `dayCountPresets` entry is offered.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tooltip` | `ReactNode \| null` | — | Hover-only hint (force-closed while the menu is open); defaults to the "Select view" label. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Replaces the default trigger content (current view name + chevron). |

### EventCalendarDatePicker

Optional go-to-date popover (shadcn Calendar), not part of the default nav; compose it yourself. It is
view-aware: week, N-days, and agenda highlight the whole active range, other views select a single
date.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `"auto" \| "single" \| "range"` | `"auto"` | `"auto"` resolves to `"range"` for week/N-days/agenda and `"single"` otherwise. |
| `tooltip` | `ReactNode \| null` | `null` | No tooltip by default (the button opens an overlay); pass a node to opt in. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Replaces the default calendar icon. |

### EventCalendarToolbar

Free slot for consumer toolbar buttons; a pure layout shell (`flex items-center gap-2`) with
`useRender` support and the `classNames.toolbar` hook. No props beyond standard `div` props.

### EventCalendarContent

Active-view switchboard: renders the component registered for the current view and exposes
`data-view` / `data-loading` attributes. While `loading` is true it dims and disables pointer events.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `components` | `Partial<Record<CalendarView, ComponentType>>` | — | Swap individual view implementations (merged over the root `components` prop). |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Replaces the switchboard entirely; read `useEventCalendarView()` inside. |

### EventCalendarMonthView

ARIA-grid month view: week rows, day cells, continuous multi-day bars in a lane overlay, "+N more"
overflow, week numbers, and the day add affordance.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `maxEventsPerCell` | `number \| "auto"` | — | Per-view override of the `maxEventsPerCell` view config (bars plus chips). |

### EventCalendarTimeGrid

The shared week/day/N-days engine: hour gutter, minute-positioned event blocks with overlap packing,
the all-day row, drag ghosts, and the now indicator. You usually render one of the wrappers below
instead.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `view` | `"week" \| "day" \| "days"` | — | Required. Which time-based view this grid renders. |
| `dayStartHour` | `number` | — | Per-view override of the `dayStartHour` option. |
| `dayEndHour` | `number` | — | Per-view override of the `dayEndHour` option. |
| `showAllDay` | `boolean` | `true` | Render the all-day row above the time track. |
| `interval` | `number` | — | Gutter/gridline interval in minutes (clamped 5 to 240); defaults to the `interval` view config. |

### EventCalendarWeekView

Thin wrapper around `EventCalendarTimeGrid` with `view` preset to `"week"`. Accepts every
`EventCalendarTimeGrid` prop except `view`.

### EventCalendarDayView

Thin wrapper around `EventCalendarTimeGrid` with `view` preset to `"day"`. Accepts every
`EventCalendarTimeGrid` prop except `view`.

### EventCalendarDaysView

Thin wrapper around `EventCalendarTimeGrid` with `view` preset to `"days"`. Accepts every
`EventCalendarTimeGrid` prop except `view`.

### EventCalendarAgendaView

Chronological list grouped by day: sticky date gutters, collapsible days with a color-dot summary
row, expandable per-event details (via `renderAgendaEventDetails`), and a compact empty state. The
agenda window length comes from the `agendaDayCount` option, so the view has no props beyond standard
`div` props.

### EventCalendarResourceView

Resource-columns day grid for booking scenarios: one time axis, one column per leaf resource (from the
`resources` option, flattened depth-first), with full drag, resize, and drag-create across columns.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dayStartHour` | `number` | — | Per-view override of the `dayStartHour` option. |
| `dayEndHour` | `number` | — | Per-view override of the `dayEndHour` option. |
| `showAllDay` | `boolean` | `true` | Render the all-day row above the time track. |
| `interval` | `number` | — | Gutter/gridline interval in minutes (clamped 5 to 240); defaults to the `interval` view config. |

### EventCalendarApi

The imperative API, available as `instance.api`, through `apiRef`, or from any hook's instance.
Reading methods reflect the current snapshot; writing methods respect controlled props (they call the
matching `on*Change` callback and only mutate internal state for uncontrolled fields).

| Method | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `next` / `prev` | `() => void` | Step the anchor date one period forward or backward for the current view. |
| `today` | `() => void` | Jump to now. |
| `goTo` | `(date: Date) => void` | Jump to a date. |
| `setView` | `(view: CalendarView, opts?: { dayCount?: number }) => void` | Switch view; unknown views fall back to the first enabled view with a dev warning. |
| `setDayCount` | `(count: number) => void` | Set the N-day count (min 1). |
| `getEvents` | `() => CalendarEvent[]` | Current events array. |

| `getActiveRange` | `() => EventCalendarDateRange` | The logical period (the month or week itself). |
| `toZoned` | `(date: Date) => Date` | The instant re-expressed in the calendar's display time zone (a `TZDate`). |
| `scrollToTime` | `(time: Date \| number) => void` | Scroll a time grid to an instant or minutes-from-day-start; no-op outside time-grid views. |

### CalendarEvent

Your event objects. `TData` is a fully generic consumer payload.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | — | Required. Stable event id. |
| `title` | `string` | — | Required. Display title. |
| `start` | `Date` | — | Required. Start instant (consumers parse ISO strings themselves). |
| `end` | `Date` | — | Required. Exclusive end instant; must be greater than or equal to `start`. |
| `allDay` | `boolean` | — | Render as an all-day bar; date comparison is day-granular in the display zone. |
| `recurrence` | `EventCalendarRecurrenceRule \| string` | — | Structured rule or a raw `"RRULE:..."` line. |
| `recurringEventId` | `string` | — | Marks this event as an edited single occurrence of that series. |
| `originalStart` | `Date` | — | Which occurrence it replaces (RECURRENCE-ID semantics). |
| `color` | `string` | — | Token or CSS color; flows to the `--ec-event-color` CSS variable. |
| `readOnly` | `boolean` | — | Excluded from drag and resize regardless of the interactions state. |
| `draggable` | `boolean` | — | Per-event override; the default comes from `interactions.drag`. |
| `resizable` | `boolean` | — | Per-event override; the default comes from `interactions.resize`. |
| `priority` | `number` | — | Packing prominence; feeds the `getEventPriority` ordering. |
| `zIndex` | `number` | — | Explicit stacking override; wins over the computed z-index. |
| `resourceId` | `string` | — | Bookable resource this event belongs to (resource view). |
| `data` | `TData` | — | Consumer payload, fully generic. |

### EventCalendarResource

A bookable resource (room, person, equipment). Nested resources render their leaves as booking columns
in the resource view.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | — | Required. Stable resource id. |
| `title` | `string` | — | Required. Column header text (or `renderResourceHeader`). |
| `color` | `string` | — | Token or CSS color for subtle row/column accents. |
| `children` | `EventCalendarResource[]` | — | Child resources; only leaves become booking columns. |

### EventCalendarRecurrenceRule

The structured RFC 5545 subset. A raw `RRULE` string with the same parts is equally accepted on
`event.recurrence`.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `freq` | `"daily" \| "weekly" \| "monthly" \| "yearly"` | — | Required. Recurrence frequency. |
| `interval` | `number` | `1` | Every N periods. |
| `count` | `number` | — | Total number of occurrences. |
| `until` | `Date` | — | Inclusive end instant. |
| `byWeekday` | `Array<EventCalendarWeekday \| string>` | — | Weekdays; ordinals (`2TU`, `-1FR`) apply to monthly/yearly rules. |
| `byMonthDay` | `number[]` | — | Days of the month; negative values count back from month end. |
| `byMonth` | `number[]` | — | Months (1 to 12) for yearly rules. |
| `weekStart` | `EventCalendarWeekday` | — | WKST equivalent. |
| `exDates` | `Date[]` | — | Excluded instants; matching occurrences are removed (they still consume their `count` slot). |
| `rDates` | `Date[]` | — | Extra instants added to the series, each with the event's own duration. |

`EventCalendarWeekday` is `"MO" | "TU" | "WE" | "TH" | "FR" | "SA" | "SU"`. For rule parts outside this
subset, plug a full RRULE engine through the `getOccurrences` option; unsupported parts throw
`EventCalendarRecurrenceError`.

### EventCalendarOccurrence

One expanded instance of an event, as passed to click callbacks and returned by
`api.getOccurrences`.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | `string` | Stable per instance: `` `${event.id}::${startISO}` ``. |
| `eventId` | `string` | The source event id. |
| `event` | `CalendarEvent` | The source event. |
| `start` / `end` | `Date` | This instance's instants (end exclusive). |
| `allDay` | `boolean` | Resolved all-day flag. |
| `isRecurring` | `boolean` | Whether it came from a recurrence expansion. |
| `recurrenceIndex` | `number` | Series ordinal, when recurring. |

### EventCalendarSegment

A per-day slice of an occurrence, produced by the event index and consumed by `EventCalendarEvent` and
the layout hooks. Positional fields are filled per surface: `startMin` / `endMin` for timed blocks,
`lane` / `column` / `columnCount` / `columnSpan` for packing, and `rowIndex` / `colStart` / `colSpan`
for month/all-day bars. `isStart` / `isEnd` and `continuesBefore` / `continuesAfter` mark cross-day
edges.

### EventCalendarProposedUpdate

The payload of `onEventUpdate` and `canDropEvent`: a proposed timing (and optionally resource) change.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `event` | `CalendarEvent` | The event being changed. |
| `occurrence` | `EventCalendarOccurrence \| null` | The dragged occurrence; `null` when `source` is `"api"`. |
| `start` | `Date` | Proposed start. |
| `end` | `Date` | Proposed exclusive end. |
| `allDay` | `boolean` | Proposed all-day flag. |
| `resourceId` | `string` | Proposed resource when the gesture crossed resource columns. |
| `source` | `"drag" \| "resize-start" \| "resize-end" \| "keyboard" \| "api"` | What produced the proposal. |

The `onEventUpdate` return type is `EventCalendarUpdateResult`: `false` rejects and reverts, `void` or
`true` accepts, and `{ start?, end?, allDay? }` accepts with an adjustment.

### EventCalendarSlotInfo

The payload of `onSlotClick`. A click is a point, not a range.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `date` | `Date` | Clicked instant (snapped in time grids) or day (day-granular surfaces). |
| `end` | `Date` | Present for timed slots: `date` plus `slotDuration`. |
| `allDay` | `boolean` | Whether the click landed on a day-granular surface. |
| `view` | `CalendarView` | The view the click happened in. |
| `resourceId` | `string` | Present when the click happened inside a resource column. |

### EventCalendarSlotDraft

The drag-create rectangle, passed to `onSelectSlot` and `canSelectSlot`. The in-progress draft lives
in state as `slotDraft` and is cleared on commit or cancel; the committed slot selection lives in
`selection.slot`.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `start` | `Date` | Draft start. |
| `end` | `Date` | Draft exclusive end. |
| `allDay` | `boolean` | Whether the draft was drawn on a day-granular surface. |
| `view` | `CalendarView` | The view the draft was drawn in. |
| `resourceId` | `string` | Present when the slot was selected inside a resource column. |

### EventCalendarState

The store snapshot, as received by `useEventCalendarSelector` selectors and `instance.getState()`.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `view` | `CalendarView` | Active view (`"month" \| "week" \| "day" \| "days" \| "agenda" \| "resource"`). |
| `date` | `Date` | Anchor date. |
| `dayCount` | `number` | Day count for the `days` view. |
| `visibleRange` | `EventCalendarDateRange` | Full rendered grid range including outside days; fetch remote data for this. |
| `activeRange` | `EventCalendarDateRange` | The logical period (the month or week itself). |
| `events` | `CalendarEvent[]` | Current events. |
| `selection` | `EventCalendarSelection` | Selected occurrence keys plus the committed slot. |
| `interactions` | `EventCalendarInteractions` | Effective interaction toggles. |
| `loading` | `boolean` | The `loading` prop. |
| `drag` | `EventCalendarDragState \| null` | Live move/resize gesture (kind, occurrence, proposed instants, validity), or `null`. |
| `slotDraft` | `EventCalendarSlotDraft \| null` | Live drag-create rectangle, or `null`. |
| `viewSettings` | `EventCalendarViewSettings` | User display toggles. |

`EventCalendarDateRange` is `{ start: Date; end: Date }` with an inclusive start and an exclusive end.
The exported `EventCalendarDataAdapter` type (`getEvents(range, signal?)`) describes the shape of an
external data source; wiring it to a backend is application territory.

## Hooks

Most hooks require an `<EventCalendar>` ancestor. The exceptions: `useEventCalendarState` creates the
instance itself, `useNow` is standalone, `useEventCalendarSettingsVersion` takes the instance as an
argument, and hooks that accept an explicit `calendar` option work outside the tree.

| Hook | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `useEventCalendarState` | `(options?: UseEventCalendarStateOptions) => EventCalendarInstance` | Headless root hook: the full engine without markup. Pass the instance to `<EventCalendar calendar={...}>` or drive fully custom UI from `getState` / `subscribe` / `api`. |
| `useEventCalendar` | `() => EventCalendarInstance` | The stable calendar instance from context; throws outside `<EventCalendar>`. |
| `useEventCalendarSelector` | `(selector: (state: EventCalendarState) => T, options?: { calendar?, isEqual? }) => T` | Fine-grained subscription with equality memoization (`Object.is` default). |
| `useEventCalendarView` | `() => { view, dayCount, availableViews, setView }` | Active view state plus the resolved `views` option. |
| `useEventCalendarNavigation` | `() => { date, title, visibleRange, activeRange, next, prev, today, goTo, isToday }` | Navigation state and actions; `title` is the formatted period title. |
| `useEventCalendarSelection` | `() => { selection, select, selectEvent, clearSelection }` | Selection state and actions. |
| `useEventCalendarInteractions` | `() => { interactions, setInteractions }` | Interaction toggles. |
| `useEventCalendarOccurrences` | `(range?: EventCalendarDateRange) => EventCalendarOccurrence[]` | Expanded, sorted occurrences; defaults to the visible range. |
| `useEventCalendarDay` | `(day: Date) => { segments: { allDay, timed }, isToday, isOutside }` | Per-cell subscription; only cells whose segments changed re-render. |
| `useEventCalendarWeek` | `(day: Date) => { bars, laneCount, rowStart }` | Per-week-row subscription for the month view's laned multi-day bars. |
| `useEventCalendarViewSettings` | `() => { viewSettings, setViewSettings, effective }` | User display toggles plus the effective values after view-config fallback. |
| `useEventCalendarSettings` | `() => EventCalendarSettings` | Resolved settings including merged i18n; re-renders only when settings change. |
| `useEventCalendarSettingsVersion` | `(instance: EventCalendarInstance) => number` | Subscribes to settings changes only (version counter, not state). |
| `useEventCalendarViewConfig` | `() => EventCalendarViewConfig` | Root-level display props and render overrides, for view components. |
| `useEventCalendarViewContext` | `() => { view: CalendarView }` | The rendering view of the nearest view component; throws outside a view. |
| `useEventCalendarGestures` | `() => { beginMove, beginResize, beginCreate, canDrag, canResize }` | Per-chip / per-surface pointer gesture wiring for custom views and cells. |
| `useEventCalendarEventChip` | `() => { occurrence, segment, isDragging, isSelected }` | The chip's subject; usable inside `renderEvent` content and chip children. |
| `useNow` | `(intervalMs?: number) => Date` | Current time, refreshed on an interval (default 30000 ms) and on tab focus. |

An `EventCalendarInstance` is `{ getState, subscribe, api, settings, internals }`; `internals` is
cross-file plumbing for sibling view modules and not public API.

## Helpers

Pure, React-free helpers exported from `event-calendar-lib.tsx` (plus the gesture flags from
`event-calendar-dnd.tsx`). `event-calendar-lib.tsx` also exports the advanced types
`EventCalendarIndex`, `EventCalendarDayBucket`, and `EventCalendarWeekRow` used in these signatures,
and `event-calendar.tsx` exports the `EventCalendarContext`, `EventCalendarViewConfigContext`, and
`EventCalendarViewContext` context objects for advanced composition.

| Function | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `flattenResources` | `(resources: EventCalendarResource[], depth?: number) => Array<EventCalendarResource & { depth: number }>` | Depth-first flatten of the resource tree, parents included. |
| `buildEventIndex` | `(events, visibleRange, opts) => EventCalendarIndex` | Expand, segment, and pack all events for a range into `{ occurrences, byDay, weekRows }`. |
| `segmentOccurrence` | `(occurrence, range, timeZone) => EventCalendarSegment[]` | The canonical multi-day segmentation (exclusive end, zero-duration safe). |
| `packTimedSegments` | `(segments) => void` | Google-style overlap packing for one day's timed segments (mutates `column` fields in place). |
| `packWeekRowLanes` | `(segments, rowIndex, rowStart, timeZone) => EventCalendarSegment[]` | Greedy lane packing of bar segments within one week row; returns new merged bar segments. |
| `defaultEventOrder` | `(a, b: EventCalendarOccurrence) => number` | Default sort: earlier start, then longer duration, then key. |
| `getViewDateRange` | `(view, date, opts) => { visibleRange, activeRange }` | The rendered and logical ranges for a view and anchor date. |
| `stepDate` | `(view, date, direction, opts) => Date` | The anchor date stepped one period forward or backward. |
| `toZoned` | `(date: Date, timeZone: string) => TZDate` | The instant re-expressed in the display time zone. |
| `zonedStartOfDay` | `(date: Date, timeZone: string) => TZDate` | Zoned midnight of the day containing the instant. |
| `getDayKey` | `(date: Date, timeZone: string) => string` | Stable per-day key (`yyyy-MM-dd`) in the display time zone. |
| `getDayTotalMinutes` | `(dayStart: Date, timeZone: string) => number` | Day length in minutes; 1380/1500 on DST transition days. |
| `getRangeKey` | `(range: EventCalendarDateRange) => string` | Cheap string cache key for a range. |
| `snapMinutes` | `(minutes: number, snap: number) => number` | Round minutes to the nearest snap step. |
| `rangesIntersect` | `(a, b: EventCalendarDateRange) => boolean` | Half-open range intersection. |
| `eventsOverlap` | `(a, b: { start: Date; end: Date }) => boolean` | Half-open overlap test. |
| `isBarOccurrence` | `(occurrence: EventCalendarOccurrence) => boolean` | True when the occurrence renders as a bar (all-day or multi-day). |
| `spansMultipleDays` | `(occ: { start: Date; end: Date }) => boolean` | Longer than 24 hours (an event ending exactly at midnight is single-day). |
| `resolveOffDay` | `(day, timeZone, config: boolean \| EventCalendarOffDaysConfig \| undefined) => boolean` | Whether a day is an off day in the display zone. |
| `minuteBlockStyle` | `(startMin, endMin, boundsStartMin) => CSSProperties` | Absolute top/height for a minute-positioned overlay block (from `event-calendar-time-grid.tsx`). |
| `wasRecentDrag` | `() => boolean` | True shortly after a gesture ended; lets click handlers ignore the click that ends a drag. |
| `wasRecentChipPress` | `() => boolean` | True shortly after a press started on an event chip; guards slot-create clicks. |
| `markChipPress` | `() => void` | Flag a chip press (called by `EventCalendarEvent`); needed when building custom chips. |

Useful exported constants: `BASE_VIEWS` and `ALL_VIEWS` (the view lists), `DEFAULT_VIEW_CONFIG`,
`DEFAULT_VIEW_COMPONENTS` (the view switchboard map), `EVENT_CALENDAR_ACTIVATION` (gesture defaults),
`EVENT_CALENDAR_COLORS` (ten Tailwind palette presets for `event.color`), `EVENT_CALENDAR_GHOST` (the
standardized drag-ghost classes), `EVENT_CALENDAR_FADE_TRUNCATE` (the fade-out truncation classes,
reusable in `renderEvent` content), `MIN_PACK_SLOT` (packing-effective minimum of 30 minutes), and
`MAX_OCCURRENCES` (recurrence expansion cap of 1000 per event).

### Recurrence helpers

Exported from `event-calendar-recurrence.tsx`. The supported `RRULE` subset is `FREQ` (daily, weekly,
monthly, yearly), `INTERVAL`, `COUNT`, `UNTIL`, `BYDAY` (with ordinals for monthly/yearly),
`BYMONTHDAY`, `BYMONTH`, and `WKST`; anything else throws `EventCalendarRecurrenceError`, whose
message points at the `getOccurrences` escape hatch.

| Function | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `expandRecurrence` | `(event, range, ctx: { timeZone }) => EventCalendarOccurrence[]` | Expand one event into its occurrences intersecting the range; wall-time iteration in the display zone (DST-safe). |
| `parseRRuleString` | `(input: string, timeZone?: string) => EventCalendarRecurrenceRule` | Parse a raw `RRULE` line (with or without the prefix); Z-less `UNTIL` values are wall time in the given zone. |
| `formatRRuleString` | `(rule: EventCalendarRecurrenceRule) => string` | Serialize the structured subset back to an `RRULE` line (without prefix). |

## Config

### State options

Option props accepted by `EventCalendar` and `useEventCalendarState`. Controlled/uncontrolled pairs
follow the standard convention: pass the controlled prop plus its `on*Change` callback, or the
`default*` prop for internal state.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `events` / `defaultEvents` | `CalendarEvent[]` | `[]` | The events (controlled / uncontrolled). |
| `view` / `defaultView` | `CalendarView` | `"month"` | Active view. |
| `date` / `defaultDate` | `Date` | `new Date()` | Anchor date. |
| `dayCount` / `defaultDayCount` | `number` | `3` | Day count for the `days` view (min 1). |
| `selection` / `defaultSelection` | `EventCalendarSelection` | `{ eventKeys: [], slot: null }` | Selection state. |
| `interactions` / `defaultInteractions` | `Partial<EventCalendarInteractions>` | all `true` | Interaction toggles, merged over the defaults. |
| `viewSettings` / `defaultViewSettings` | `EventCalendarViewSettings` | `{}` | User display toggles. |
| `loading` | `boolean` | `false` | Dims the content area and disables pointer events. |
| `views` | `CalendarView[]` | base views | Enabled views; defaults to `["month", "week", "day", "days", "agenda"]`, plus `"resource"` when `resources` is non-empty. |
| `timeZone` | `string` | system time zone | IANA display time zone; all day math and rendering happen in it. |
| `locale` | `Locale` | — | date-fns locale for every formatted string. |
| `weekStartsOn` | `0 \| 1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5 \| 6` | `locale` | First day of the week (0 = Sunday). Defaults to the `locale`'s own first day when one is set, so a German or French calendar starts on Monday; an explicit value always wins. |
| `dayStartHour` | `number` | `0` | First rendered hour in time grids. |
| `dayEndHour` | `number` | `24` | Last rendered hour in time grids. |
| `slotDuration` | `number` | `30` | Duration in minutes of a click-created slot (`onSlotClick` end). |
| `snapDuration` | `number` | `15` | Snap granularity in minutes for drag, resize, and drag-create. |
| `agendaDayCount` | `number` | `30` | Days covered by the agenda view window. |
| `fixedWeeks` | `boolean` | `true` | Month view always renders 6 weeks. |
| `showOutsideDays` | `boolean` | `true` | Show leading/trailing outside days in the month view. |
| `i18n` | `Partial<EventCalendarI18nConfig>` | — | Per-key overrides of labels, view names, formats, and formatter functions. |
| `resources` | `EventCalendarResource[]` | `[]` | Bookable resources for the resource view. |
| `getEventPriority` | `(event: CalendarEvent) => number` | `event.priority ?? 0` | Packing prominence resolver. |
| `eventOrder` | `(a, b: EventCalendarOccurrence) => number` | `defaultEventOrder` | Occurrence sort comparator (default: earlier start, then longer duration, then key). |
| `getOccurrences` | `(event, range, ctx: { timeZone }) => Array<EventCalendarOccurrence> \| null` | — | Custom recurrence expansion per event (plug a full RRULE engine); return `null` for the built-in one. |
| `weekendDays` | `number[]` | `[0, 6]` | Weekday numbers treated as the weekend by the "weekends" view toggle. |
| `activation` | `Partial<EventCalendarActivationConfig>` | see below | Pointer-gesture tuning. |

`EventCalendarActivationConfig` defaults: `moveDistancePx: 5`, `createDistancePx: 4`,
`touchDelayMs: 250`, `touchTolerancePx: 5`, `autoScrollEdgePx: 48`, `autoScrollMaxStepPx: 15` (exported
as `EVENT_CALENDAR_ACTIVATION`).

### Callbacks

Callback props accepted by `EventCalendar` and `useEventCalendarState`, alongside the options above.

| Prop | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `onEventClick` | `(occurrence, e: React.MouseEvent) => void` | Chip click; call `e.preventDefault()` to opt out of the built-in selection. |
| `onEventDoubleClick` | `(occurrence, e: React.MouseEvent) => void` | Chip double click. |
| `onEventUpdate` | `(update: EventCalendarProposedUpdate) => EventCalendarUpdateResult` | The one validation funnel for drags, resizes, and API timing changes; `false` rejects, an object adjusts. |
| `canDropEvent` | `(update: EventCalendarProposedUpdate) => boolean` | Live validation during a gesture; drives the `data-drop-invalid` styling and the not-allowed cursor. |
| `onDragBlocked` | `(occurrence, info: { gesture: "move" \| "resize"; reason: "readOnly" \| "disabled" \| "interactions-off" }) => void` | A gesture was attempted on a locked event; fires once per gesture so you can surface a message. |
| `onSlotClick` | `(slot: EventCalendarSlotInfo, e: React.MouseEvent) => void` | Click on an empty slot or day cell (also fired by the day add button). |
| `onSelectSlot` | `(slot: EventCalendarSlotDraft) => void` | A drag-create selection was committed. |
| `canSelectSlot` | `(slot: EventCalendarSlotDraft) => boolean` | Live validation of the drag-create rectangle. |
| `onRangeChange` | `(info: EventCalendarRangeInfo) => void` | Visible range changed (view, date, or time zone); fires once for the initial range. `info` carries `range`, `activeRange`, `view`, `date`, and `timeZone`. |
| `onViewChange` | `(view: CalendarView) => void` | View changed. |
| `onDateChange` | `(date: Date) => void` | Anchor date changed. |
| `onDayCountChange` | `(count: number) => void` | N-day count changed. |
| `onSelectionChange` | `(selection: EventCalendarSelection) => void` | Selection changed. |
| `onInteractionsChange` | `(interactions: EventCalendarInteractions) => void` | Interaction toggles changed. |
| `onViewSettingsChange` | `(viewSettings: EventCalendarViewSettings) => void` | User display toggles changed. |
| `onEventsChange` | `(events: CalendarEvent[]) => void` | Events array changed (drag commit, resize, API mutation). |
| `onMoreClick` | `(day: Date, occurrences: EventCalendarOccurrence[], e: React.MouseEvent) => void \| false` | "+N more" clicked; return `false` to suppress the built-in popover and open your own UI. |

### View configuration

Display props and render overrides, accepted directly on `EventCalendar` (they live in the view layer,
never in the headless options). Defaults come from `DEFAULT_VIEW_CONFIG`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scrollToHour` | `number` | `7` | Hour the time grids scroll to on mount. |
| `nowIndicator` | `boolean` | `true` | Show the current-time line in time grids. |
| `interval` | `number` | `60` | Grid interval in minutes for time-based views; gutter slots and gridlines follow it. Also accepted per view component. |
| `maxEventsPerCell` | `number \| "auto"` | `"auto"` | Max bars plus chips per month cell before "+N more". |
| `showWeekNumbers` | `boolean` | `false` | Week-number gutter in the month view. |
| `enableShortcuts` | `boolean` | `true` | View-switcher keyboard shortcuts and their `kbd` hints. |
| `shortcutsScope` | `"focus-within" \| "global"` | `"focus-within"` | Where the shortcuts listen. |
| `scrollMode` | `"contained" \| "page"` | `"contained"` | Contained: the calendar fills its container and views scroll internally. Page: content flows with the document and day headers stick below `--ec-sticky-offset`. |
| `stickyNav` | `boolean` | `false` | Stick the default nav to the top while the page scrolls. |
| `dayClassName` | `(day: Date) => string \| undefined` | — | Custom per-day indication on month cells, day columns, and all-day cells. |
| `todayClassName` | `string` | — | Extra classes for the current day, appended after the built-in highlight. |
| `showDayAddButton` | `boolean` | `false` | Hover "+" affordance on month cells; fires the same `onSlotClick` as clicking the day. |
| `scrollbars` | `"custom" \| "native"` | `"custom"` | Scroll implementation for every internally scrolling surface (shadcn ScrollArea vs browser scrollbars). |
| `navButtonVariant` | `"ghost" \| "outline" \| "secondary" \| "default"` | `"ghost"` | Variant applied to all nav buttons. |
| `navButtonSize` | `"sm" \| "default"` | `"sm"` | Size applied to all nav buttons (icon buttons use the icon twin). |
| `offDays` | `boolean \| EventCalendarOffDaysConfig` | — | Off-day (non-working day) marking; `true` = weekends with a muted background. |
| `classNames` | `EventCalendarClassNames` | — | Per-element class hooks; see below. |
| `components` | `Partial<Record<CalendarView, ComponentType>>` | — | Swap individual view implementations. |
| `dayCountPresets` | `number[]` | `[5]` | N-day presets offered by the view switcher when the `days` view is enabled. |
| `navTooltips` | `false \| { side?, delay?, closeDelay?, timeout? }` | `{ side: "bottom", delay: 600, closeDelay: 0, timeout: 300 }` | Nav tooltips: `false` disables them all; the object tunes placement and timings. |
| `eventTooltip` | `boolean \| { side?, delay? }` | `false` | Styled tooltip on event hover / focus; `true` shows the event label, an object tunes side and delay. Content via `renderEventTooltip`. |
| `compactEventMinutes` | `number` | `45` | Timed events shorter than this render the compact single-row chip layout. |
| `morePopoverAlign` | `"start" \| "center" \| "end"` | `"start"` | "+N more" popover alignment against its trigger. |
| `nowIndicatorInterval` | `number` | `30000` | Now-indicator refresh cadence in milliseconds. |
| `agendaSummaryMaxDots` | `number` | `6` | Max color dots in a collapsed agenda day summary. |

Render overrides, all optional and all part of the same view config:

| Prop | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `renderEvent` | `(props: EventCalendarRenderEventProps) => ReactNode` | Replace the chip content in grid views; receives `occurrence`, `segment`, `view`, `isDragging`, `isSelected`. |
| `renderAgendaEvent` | `(props: EventCalendarRenderEventProps) => ReactNode` | Replace the agenda row content. |
| `renderEventTooltip` | `(props: { occurrence, segment, view, label }) => ReactNode` | Content for the styled hover tooltip (`eventTooltip`); a falsy return falls back to the default label. |
| `renderDragPreview` | `(props: { drag: EventCalendarDragState }) => ReactNode` | Custom drag preview content. |
| `renderMonthCell` | `(props: { day, segments, isToday, isOutside, overflowCount, defaultContent }) => ReactNode` | Replace a month cell's body; `defaultContent` lets you wrap instead of rebuild. |
| `renderDayColumnBackground` | `(props: { day, boundsStartMin, boundsEndMin, totalMinutes }) => ReactNode` | Business-logic layer rendered pointer-events-none behind event segments in each day column. |
| `renderDayHeader` | `(props: { day, view, isToday }) => ReactNode` | Replace day header cells (month header row and time-grid headers). |
| `renderTimeGutterSlot` | `(props: { time, hour, minute }) => ReactNode` | Replace hour gutter labels. |
| `renderAllDaySection` | `(props: { days, segments }) => ReactNode` | Replace the entire all-day row of time grids. |
| `renderMoreIndicator` | `(props: { day, count, segments }) => ReactNode` | Replace the "+N more" trigger content. |
| `renderMoreContent` | `(props: { day, segments, close }) => ReactNode` | Replace the entire body of the built-in "+N more" popover while keeping its trigger and positioning. |
| `renderAgendaEventDetails` | `(occurrence: EventCalendarOccurrence) => ReactNode` | Agenda-only expandable details; returning a node gives the row an expand/collapse toggle. |
| `renderNowIndicator` | `(props: { time: Date }) => ReactNode` | Replace the current-time line. |
| `renderNoEvents` | `() => ReactNode` | Replace the agenda empty state. |
| `renderResourceHeader` | `(props: { resource: EventCalendarResource }) => ReactNode` | Resource column header content; default is `resource.title`. |
| `renderAgendaDayHeader` | `(props: { day, collapsed, count, toggle, defaultContent }) => ReactNode` | Replace the agenda date gutter (day badge, weekday, collapse toggle). |
| `renderAgendaDaySummary` | `(props: { day, occurrences, count, expand, defaultContent }) => ReactNode` | Replace the collapsed agenda day summary row content. |

The `classNames` object (`EventCalendarClassNames`) offers one string hook per element, cn-merged
after the built-in classes so Tailwind variants and `!` overrides win. Available keys: `nav`,
`toolbar`, `content`, `monthView`, `monthCell`, `timeGrid`, `timeGutter`, `dayColumn`,
`allDaySection`, `agendaView`, `event`, `eventTooltip`, `moreIndicator`, `morePopover`,
`morePopoverHeader`; nav family `navButton`, `title`, `navTooltip`, `viewSwitcherContent`,
`viewSwitcherLabel`, `viewShortcut`, `datePickerContent`; month view `monthHeader`, `monthDayHeader`,
`monthBody`, `monthRow`, `weekNumber`, `monthBarOverlay`, `monthBar`, `monthCellContent`,
`monthCellFooter`, `monthDayNumber`, `dayAddButton`; time grid and resource `timeGridHeader`,
`timeGutterLabel`, `allDayLabel`, `allDayCell`, `timedChip`, `resourceHeader`; interaction surfaces
`dragGhost`, `dragCarry`, `dragCarryInvalid`, `dropHint`, `dropIndicator`, `slotDraft`,
`resizeHandle`, `resizeGrip`; agenda `noEvents`, `agendaDay`, `agendaDayGutter`, `agendaDate`,
`agendaDayToggle`, `agendaDayContent`, `agendaItem`, `agendaItemSurface`, `agendaItemToggle`,
`agendaDaySummary`, `agendaSummaryDot`. Metric CSS variables can ride on any parent key, for example
`classNames.timeGrid: "[--ec-gutter-width:4rem]"` or `classNames.morePopover:
"[--ec-more-max-height:20rem]"`.

### EventCalendarInteractions

Interaction toggles, controllable via the `interactions` prop or `api.setInteractions`. All three
default to `true`.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `drag` | `boolean` | `true` | Move events by dragging. |
| `resize` | `boolean` | `true` | Resize events at their edges. |
| `selectSlot` | `boolean` | `true` | Drag-create slot selection. |

### EventCalendarViewSettings

User-adjustable display toggles (the "view settings" state), controllable via `viewSettings` /
`onViewSettingsChange` or `api.setViewSettings`. Every field is optional; `undefined` defers to the
matching view-config prop (see `useEventCalendarViewSettings().effective`).

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `weekends` | `boolean` | — | Show Saturday/Sunday columns in month, week, and N-day grids (effective default `true`). |
| `weekNumbers` | `boolean` | — | Week-number gutter in the month view (defers to `showWeekNumbers`). |
| `nowIndicator` | `boolean` | — | Current-time line (defers to the `nowIndicator` view config). |
| `offDays` | `boolean` | — | Off-day background marking (defers to the `offDays` view config). |

### EventCalendarOffDaysConfig

Configuration for non-working-day marking, passed as the `offDays` view config. `true` uses the
defaults (weekends with a muted background); marked cells carry `data-off` for CSS-selector
customization.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `weekendDays` | `number[]` | `[0, 6]` | Weekday numbers treated as off (0 = Sunday). |
| `dates` | `Date[]` | — | Additional explicit off dates (compared by day in the display zone). |
| `isOffDay` | `(day: Date) => boolean` | — | Full custom predicate; runs in addition to `weekendDays` / `dates`. |
| `className` | `string` | `"bg-muted/40"` | Marker classes. |

### Internationalization

The `i18n` option accepts a `Partial<EventCalendarI18nConfig>` with four sections, shallow-merged per
nested object so a partial override replaces individual keys, never whole sections:

- `labels`: UI strings and label functions (`today`, `previous`, `next`, `addEvent`, `allDay`,
  `more(count)`, `noEvents`, `loading`, `event`, `events(count)`, `selectView`, `week(weekNumber)`,
  `resources`, `goToDate`, `dropNotAllowed`, `continues`, `timeFrom(time)`, `timeUntil(time)`,
  `viewShortcuts`, `toggleDayEvents(count, expanded)`, `eventDetails(title)`, `moreCompact(count)`,
  `timeRange(from, to)`).
- `viewNames`: display names per view (`month`, `week`, `day`, `days(count)`, `agenda`, `resource`).
- `formats`: date-fns format strings applied with the calendar `locale` (`monthTitle`, `weekTitle`,
  `dayTitle`, `agendaTitle`, `monthDayHeader`, `monthDayHeaderNarrow`, `timeGridDayHeader`,
  `agendaDayHeader`, `agendaDayNumber`, `agendaWeekday`, `moreDayHeader`, `monthCellAriaLabel`,
  `dayAria`, `resourceTitle`, `timeGutter`, `timeGutterMinute`, `eventTime`, `monthCellDay`). Leaving
  `weekTitle` undefined keeps the smart cross-month range title.
- `functions`: formatter functions (`formatTitle`, `formatEventTime`, `formatDayRange`,
  `formatEventLabel`, `formatEventAriaLabel`). The defaults are re-bound to the merged labels and
  formats, so overriding `formats.monthTitle` flows into the default `formatTitle` without replacing
  it.

`mergeEventCalendarI18n(overrides?)` performs this merge and `DEFAULT_EVENT_CALENDAR_I18N` holds the
defaults; both are exported from `event-calendar-i18n.tsx` for standalone use.

## Example

The docs page ships one flagship demo covering the whole feature surface: every view (month, week,
day, N-days, agenda, and the resource time grid), a multi-day all-day bar, custom chips via
`renderEvent`, and a tabbed Settings panel driving view settings, time-grid options, and interactions
as controlled props, with a reset back to defaults. It is long (~550 lines); full source is in
[EVENT-CALENDAR-EXAMPLE.md](./EVENT-CALENDAR-EXAMPLE.md).

## Base UI vs Radix UI

Detect your build from `components.json` -> `style`: `base-nova` -> Base UI (this file's default),
`radix-nova` -> Radix UI.

| | Base UI | Radix UI |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @reui/event-calendar` | (same name; the registry resolves the build from `components.json`) |
| Composition idiom on `EventCalendar`, `EventCalendarNav`, `EventCalendarToolbar` | `render={...}` prop | `asChild` prop |

Real, stated differences:

- **`EventCalendar`'s customization prop**: Base UI exposes `render` (a `useRender` render prop,
  "Replace the rendered root element"); Radix exposes `asChild: boolean` (default `false`, "Render the
  child element instead (Radix `Slot`)"). Same story for `EventCalendarNav` (`useRender` support vs
  `asChild` support) and `EventCalendarToolbar` (`useRender` support vs `asChild` support), and for
  `EventCalendarNavToday` / `EventCalendarNavPrev` / `EventCalendarNavNext`'s `render` prop (Base UI)
  vs `asChild` (Radix).
- **Trigger composition in the flagship example**: Base UI's `PopoverTrigger` takes
  `render={<Button variant="outline" size="sm" />}` with the icon/label as `PopoverTrigger` children;
  Radix's `PopoverTrigger` takes `asChild` with the `<Button>` (icon + label as its own children)
  nested directly inside.
- **shadcn `Select`/`SelectValue` behavior** (used in the settings panel of the flagship example): the
  Base UI page notes "Base UI's Value renders the raw value string by default; the selected option's
  label reads better for every control here," and so explicitly renders
  `<SelectValue>{options.find((option) => option.value === value)?.label}</SelectValue>`. The Radix
  page uses a bare `<SelectValue />` with no children override, implying Radix's `SelectValue`
  resolves the label itself.

Everything else on the page — every `EventCalendar*` component's own prop table, the full State
options / Callbacks / View configuration / Interactions / ViewSettings / OffDaysConfig tables, the
Hooks and Helpers tables, and the Internationalization section — is identical text between the two
builds.
